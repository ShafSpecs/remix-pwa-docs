Remix PWA v3.1 release focuses on Vite and Vite support, although, Remix Esbuild is still supported in Remix PWA 3.1, it is highly recommended to use Vite instead. If you still insist, check out [v3.0 docs](/docs/main/installation) for a more
comprehensive guide on how to use Remix PWA with Remix Esbuild.

<Info>
Remix PWA now supports Vite right out of the box ðŸŽ‰!

## Installation

### Remix PWA + Vite

<Warn>
Remix PWA requires a Remix application to work! If you haven't created one yet, you can
easily create one by running `npx create-remix@latest` in your terminal.
</Warn>

To install Remix PWA for Vite, run the command:

```sh {{ filename:"Terminal" }}
npm install --save-dev @remix-pwa/dev@dev
```

<Info>
Remix PWA CLI doesn't provide support for Vite yet, so you'll have to install it manually.
</Info>

## Vite Configuration

### Registering the Plugin

To utilise Vite with Remix PWA, you'll need to add the following to your `vite.config.ts`:

```ts {{ filename:"vite.config.ts" }}
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { unstable_RemixPWA as remixPWA } from '@remix-pwa/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [/* other plugins */, remixPWA()],
})
```

---

## App Configuration

### Registering Service Workers

Thanks to the new Vite plugin, you no longer need to register your Service Worker manually. The plugin would automatically inject
the necessary scripts required. You can also customise the registration parameters via the plugin.

```ts {{ filename:"vite.config.ts" }}
// ...
remixPWA({
  // ... other options
  scope: string, // SW scope. defaults to '/'
  workerName: string, // built SW name. defaults to 'entry.worker'
}),
```

This replaces the need for `loadServiceWorker` in your `entry.client.tsx` file. However, if you still want to use `loadServiceWorker` or handle it manually in `root.tsx`, you can
disable the plugin's automatic registration by setting `registerSW: null` in the plugin options.

```ts {{ filename:"vite.config.ts" }}
// ...
remixPWA({
  // ... other options
  registerSW: null,
}),
```

Check out the plugin's [API Reference]() for more information about the plugin options.

### Setup Service Worker Communication

To enable caching on client-side navigation or precaching or just to communicate with your service worker, you'll need to add the
`useSWEffect` hook to your root component in the `root.tsx` file.

```tsx {{ filename:"app/root.tsx" }}
import { useSWEffect } from '@remix-pwa/sw'

export default function App() {
  useSWEffect()
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      {/* ... */}
    </html>
  );
}
```

<Info>
The `useSWEffect` hook has had quite a few extra functionalities added to it since its last releaseEvents.
Check out the [`useSWEffect`]() page for more information.
</Info>

### Add Service Worker HMR support 

In your `root.tsx` file, replace the `LiveReload` component from `@remix-run/react` with `LiveReload` from `@remix-pwa/sw`. This will
enable HMR support for your service worker and allow you to see changes in the service worker thread in real time.

```tsx {{ filename:"app/root.tsx" }}
import { LiveReload } from '@remix-pwa/sw'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      {/* ... */}
      <body>
        {/* ... */}
        <LiveReload />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

That's it! If you followed the guide correctly, you are now good to go with utilizing Vite with Remix PWA ðŸš€.
