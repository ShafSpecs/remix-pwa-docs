Getting started with `@remix-pwa/sw` package for building, extending and customizing Service Worker in Remix.

---

`@remix-pwa/sw` is Remix PWA solution to everything Service Worker, containing all the tools you need to build,
extend and customize Service Worker in Remix. As well as integration with external tools, currently only [`Workbox`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/) is supported.

## Installation

To install `@remix-pwa/sw` package, run the following command:

```bash
# npm
npm install @remix-pwa/sw

# yarn
yarn add @remix-pwa/sw
```

You still have to set your scripts though to recognise your service workers in `package.json`.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:worker": "esbuild ./app/route-to-worker --outfile=./public/name-of-worker-file.js --minify --bundle --format=esm --define:process.env.NODE_ENV='\"production\"'",
    "dev: worker": "esbuild ./app/route-to-worker --outfile=./public/name-of-worker-file.js --bundle --format=esm --define:process.env.NODE_ENV='\"development\"' --watch"
  }
}
```

And you are ready to go! üéâ

{/* ```bash
# (todo): make this a possible command
npx @remix-pwa/sw init
````*/}
</Info>
