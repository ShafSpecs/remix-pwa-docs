Workbox is a set of libraries that make it easy to take advantage of the latest browser features, such as service workers, to improve your Remix application's offline experience.

## Installation

To get started, you would need to scaffold a Remix application with `remix-pwa`. You can do that by running the following command:

```bash
npx remix-pwa@latest
```

and during the questionnaire, select `Workbox` as your service worker library.

## Usage

Once you have a Remix application with Workbox installed, you can start using it like every other Workbox application. Refer to the [Workbox docs](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox) for more information.

One thing to note is that by using Workbox, you aren't missing out on any of `@remix-pwa/sw` features.
