If you've been running `remix-pwa@1.1.10` and below in your Remix application and want to upgrade to the latest version as well as utilize `@remix-pwa/sw`, you'll need to make a few changes to your service worke.

## Upgrade to `@remix-pwa/sw`

First, install `@remix-pwa/sw`:

```bash
npm install @remix-pwa/sw
```

Then in your `root` file, replace the `useEffect` that was previously injected by `remix-pwa` with the following:

```ts 
// root.tsx
import { useSWEffect } from '@remix-pwa/sw'

// in your root component
useSWEffect()
```

We aren't still finished, we also need to head over to our `entry.client` file and remove the injected code too. Replace with: 
  
```ts 
// entry.client.tsx
import { loadServiceWorker } from '@remix-pwa/sw'

// below the hydration code
loadServiceWorker()
```

## Upgrade your Service Worker

> This section is still in development 

Now that we've upgraded to `@remix-pwa/sw`, we might want to start customising our service worker. If you haven't edited it already, you can go ahead and delete the entire contents. 
Replace with

```ts
// entry.worker.ts
/// <reference lib="WebWorker" />

// Service Workers are quite broken in ts, this is a workaround
export type {};
declare let self: ServiceWorkerGlobalScope;

self.addEventListener('install', (event: ExtendableEvent) => {
  console.log('Service worker installed');
  event.waitUntil(self.skipWaiting());
});

self.addEventListener('activate', (event: ExtendableEvent) => {
  console.log('Service worker activated');
  event.waitUntil(self.clients.claim());
});

self.addEventListener('message', (event: ExtendableMessageEvent) => {
  console.log('Service worker received message', event.data);
});
```

A basic Service Worker that currently does nothing except to log pesky messages to the console!
