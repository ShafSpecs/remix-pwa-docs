So you have installed `@remix-pwa/sw` and you are ready to get started. This guide will walk you through the basic setup of a Service Worker in Remix.

## Create a Service Worker

The first step is to create a Service Worker. This is a TypeScript (or JavaScript) file that will be responsible for caching your assets and handling offline requests.
Create a new file in your project called `entry.worker.ts` and add the following code:

```ts
/// <reference lib="WebWorker" />

// Service Workers are quite broken in ts, this is a workaround
export type {};
declare let self: ServiceWorkerGlobalScope;

self.addEventListener("install", (event: ExtendableEvent) => {
  console.log("Service worker installed");
  event.waitUntil(self.skipWaiting());
});

self.addEventListener("activate", (event: ExtendableEvent) => {
  console.log("Service worker activated");
  event.waitUntil(self.clients.claim());
});
```

This is a basic Service Worker that when installed, would skip the [waiting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope/skipWaiting)
process of the service worker and would attempt to take over, and an `activate` listener that would ensure your service worker take control of the current client and
all other [clients](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clients). It will also log to the console when it is installed and activated.

Currently our Service Worker doesn't do anything. No request interception, caching, push handling or anything. That's fine, Remix doesn't even know about the existence of our Service Worker yet.

To fix that, add the following to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:worker": "esbuild ./app/entry.worker.ts --outfile=./public/entry.worker.js --minify --bundle --format=esm --define:process.env.NODE_ENV='\"production\"'",
    "dev:worker": "esbuild ./app/entry.worker.ts --outfile=./public/entry.worker.js --bundle --format=esm --define:process.env.NODE_ENV='\"development\"' --watch"
  }
}
```

We now use `esbuild` to bundle our script to Remix `public` directory. Finally, let's load up our Service Worker in our app.
In our `entry.client.ts` file, add the following:

```ts 
import { loadServiceWorker } from "@remix-pwa/sw";

loadServiceWorker();
```

<Info>
  If you can't locate your `entry.client.ts` file, run `npx remix reveal` and you should now see it in the `app` folder.
</Info>

Now, we have successfully loaded our Service Worker script into our Remix application ðŸ’¿!

## Basic caching 

Let's do some basic caching with our Service Worker. We would do something similar to the old `remix-pwa` templates 
(i.e Cache assets, loader data, and document pages). 

Little bit of explanantion about caching in `@remix-pwa/sw`, the package contains multiple caching strategies as classes that all extend the 
`CacheStrategy` class which contains an abstract `handle` method. This method is called when a request is made and the strategy is matched.

> Check out [Caching Strategies](/sw/cache-strategies) in the API Reference for more information.

Let's start by caching our assets. We will use the `CacheFirst` strategy for this, which is attempt to load the resource from the cache, if not found, fetch using network. In our `entry.worker.ts` file, add the following:

```ts
import { CacheFirst, matchRequest } from "@remix-pwa/sw";
import type { MatchResponse } from "@remix-pwa/sw";

// ...previous code

const assetCache = new CacheFirst({
  cacheName: "asset-cache",
  matchOptions: {
    ignoreSearch: true,
    ignorevary: true
  }
});

const fetchHandler = ({ request }: FetchEvent): Promise<Response> => {
  const matched: MatchResponse = matchRequest(
    request, 
    ["/build/", "/fonts/", "/favicon.ico"]
  );

  switch (matched) {
    case "asset":
      return assetCache.handle(request);
    case "loader":
      break;
    case "document":
      break;
    default:
      return fetch(request);
  }
}

self.addEventListener("fetch", (event: FetchEvent) => {
  event.respondWith(fetchHandler(event));
});
```

Bzzzzt ðŸ¤–! We have a basic caching strategy for our assets. Let's break down what we did a little bit.

First, we created a new `CacheFirst` strategy and passed in a `cacheName` and `matchOptions`. The `cacheName` is the name of the cache that will be created in the browser. 
The `matchOptions` is an object that contains options that will be passed to the `match` method of the `Cache` object. We set `ignoreSearch` and `ignoreVary` to `true` because 
we don't want to cache assets with query strings or assets with different `Vary` headers.

Next, we defined a `fetchHandler` which should handle all fetch events. We use the `matchRequest` function from `@remix-pwa/sw` to match the request to a type. 
If the request matches an asset, we use the `CacheFirst` strategy to handle the request. If it matches a loader or document, we do nothing and `break` (for now). 
If it doesn't match any of the above, we just fetch the request.

Finally, we add an event listener for the `fetch` event and pass in our `fetchHandler` function.

Let's implement the last two cases. Check this out: 

```ts {1, 14-17}
import { CacheFirst, matchRequest, NetworkFirst } from "@remix-pwa/sw";

// just below the `CacheFirst` strategy
const loaderCache = new NetworkFirst({
  cacheName: "data-cache",
  isLoader: true
});

const documentCache = new CacheFirst({
  cacheName: "document-cache"
});

// in the `fetchHandler` function
case "loader":
  return loaderCache.handle(request);
case "document":
  return documentCache.handle(request);
```

Now, we have a basic caching strategy for our assets, loader data, and document pages. Let's test it out!

## Handling Navigation 

> This section is still a work in progress (WIP).

Add the following to your `entry.worker.ts` file:

```ts
import { RemixNavigationHandler } from "@remix-pwa/sw";

const messageHandler = new RemixNavigationHandler();

self.addEventListener("message", (event) => {
  event.waitUntil(
    messageHandler.handle(event, {
      caches: {
        DATA,
        PAGES: DOCUMENTS,
      },
    })
  );
});
```
