This reference contains all the functions that Remix PWA exposes to help you build your own custom service worker, plus how you can replace them with your own.

## `logger`

The `logger` function is used to log messages to the console available only in development environment. It is a wrapper around `console.log` that 
logs various messages depending on the log level. The available log levels are: 

- `debug`
- `info`
- `warn`
- `error`
- `log`

You can easily disable various log levels by setting the corresponding log level to `false` at the top of your service worker file:

```ts 
// disable all logs 
self.__DISABLE_PWA_DEV_LOGS = true

// disable all debug messages 
self.__DISABLE_PWA_DEBUG_LOGS = true
```

#### Example
  
```ts
// log a debug message
logger.debug('debug message')

// log an info message
logger.info('info message')
```

## `handleFetchRequest`

The `handleFetchRequest` function is used to handle the `fetch` event with respect to a strategy. It is a simple shortcut to easily do:

```ts
myStrategy.handle(request)
```

It takes in two arguments:

- `request` - the `Request` object to handle
- `strategy` - the strategy to use to handle the request

---

## `isAssetRequest`

The `isAssetRequest` function is used to check if a request is an asset request. It takes two arguments:

- `request` - the `Request` object to check
- `assetUrls` - an optional array of asset urls to check against. If not provided, the default asset urls are used (`['/build/', '/icons']`).

---

## `isDocumentRequest`

The `isDocumentRequest` function is used to check if a request is a document request. It takes just one argument: `request`.

---

## `isLoaderRequest`

A special function provided by `@remix-pwa/sw` to detect wether a request is a loader request. Also takes just a `Request` object as parameter.

---

## `matchRequest`

The `matchRequest` function of type [`MatchRequest`](/sw/helper-reference#MatchRequest), is used to match a request against a list of urls. It takes two arguments:

- `request` - the `Request` object to match
- `assetUrls` - an array of urls to match against

In short, it does a check for all cases (loader request? asset request? document request?) and returns the corresponding string value of type [`MatchResponse`](/sw/helper-reference#MatchResponse).

### `MatchRequest`

The `MatchRequest` type is simply a function that takes in a `Request` object and an optional array of asset urls and returns a `MatchResponse` type.

### `MatchResponse`

The `MatchResponse` type is a string (or `null`) with the following values:

- `asset` - the request is an asset request
- `document` - the request is a document request
- `loader` - the request is a loader request
- `null` - the request is none of the above, and should be handled like a default request.

---

## `unregisterServiceWorker`

The `unregisterServiceWorker` function is used to unregister the service worker. It takes no arguments.

---

## `loadServiceWorker`

The `loadServiceWorker` function is used to load the service worker. It takes in two optional arguments:

- `scriptUrl` - the url of the service worker script. Defaults to `/entry.worker.js`
- `scope` - the scope of the service worker. Defaults to `/`
