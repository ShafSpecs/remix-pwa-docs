`@remix-pwa/sw` is built to be modular and extensible, meaning you can do whatever you want without breaking anything. This guide will show you how to extend the default Service Worker to add your own custom logic.

## Custom Caching Strategy 

In the [previous doc](/sw/basic-setup), we saw how to setup a basic Service Worker. `@remix-pwa/sw` provided multiple matcher functions and strategies, but no code fits all. 
Let's drum up a scenario, imagine we want to cache images separately from the rest of the assets. We can do that easily by creating a custom matcher and strategy.

### Custom Strategy

A strategy is a class that extends the `CacheStrategy` class. It's used to determine how a request should be handled by the Service Worker.
We can easily implement our own strategy by extending the `CacheStrategy` class and overriding the `_handle` method. Check out the [reference](/sw/cache-strategy) for more information.

```ts 
// entry.worker.ts
import { CacheStrategy } from '@remix-pwa/sw`

class ImageCacheStrategy extends CacheStrategy {
  // Overriding the _handle abstract method
  async _handle(request: Request) {
    const cache = await caches.open('images-cache');

    const cachedResponse = await cache.match(request, {
      ignoreSearch: this.matchOptions?.ignoreSearch ?? false,
      ignoreVary: this.matchOptions?.ignoreVary ?? false,
    });

    if (cachedResponse) {
      const response = await fetch(request);
      if (response.status === 200) {
        await cache.put(request, response.clone());
      }

      return response;
    } else {
      const response = await fetch(request);
      if (response.status === 200) {
        await cache.put(request, response.clone());
      }

      return response;
    }
  }
}
```

In here, we defined our `ImageCacheStrategy` class and overrode the `_handle` method. We first open the `images-cache` cache, then we check if the request is already cached. 
If it is, we return the cached response, otherwise we fetch the request and cache it before returning it. Simply a `CacheFirst` strategy exclusively for images. Good enough.

### Custom Matcher

A matcher is a function that takes a `Request` and returns a `boolean` or a `string` (depends on how you perform the checking). 
It's used to determine if a request should be handled by the Service Worker or not. 

We can easily implement our own matcher by creating a function that takes a `Request` and returns a `boolean`.

```ts
function isImageRequest(request: Request) {
  return request.destination === 'image';
}
```

And we can use it in our Service Worker like so:

```ts
if (isImageRequest(request)) {
  // Handle the request
}
```

Bravo üëè! you just created your own custom matcher.

### Putting it all together

Now that we have our custom strategy and matcher, we can use them in our Service Worker alongside our other strategies. 

```ts
// entry.worker.ts
const fetchHandler = ({ request }: FetchEvent): Promise<Response> => {
  if (isImageRequest(request)) {
    return imageCacheStrategy.handle(request);
  }

  if (isAssetRequest(request, ['/build/', '/assets/'])) {
    return handleFetchRequest(request, assetCacheStrategy);
  }

  if (isLoaderRequest(request)) {
    return handleFetchRequest(request, loaderCacheStrategy);
  }

  if (isDocumentRequest(request)) {
    return handleFetchRequest(request, pageCacheStrategy);
  }

  return fetch(request.clone());
}

self.addEventListener("fetch", (event: FetchEvent) => {
  event.respondWith(fetchHandler(event));
});
```

And that's it! You now have a custom strategy, you can run wild with this and create your own custom strategies and matchers. To utilise them, simply plug it in and you are good to go!
