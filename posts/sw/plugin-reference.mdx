## `MessagePlugin`

#### Remarks

- The message plugin is an interface that is implemented to add extra functionality to your Service Worker message capabilities. Example of
  that is sending information to an analytics service on every navigation.
- It contains two methods: `messageDidReceive` and `messageWillSend` that allow for implementation at multiple points in the message lifecycle.
- The `messageDidReceive` method is called when a message is received from the client.
- The `messageWillSend` method is called when a message is about to be sent back to the client.

#### Definition

```ts
interface MessagePlugin {
  messageDidReceive?: (env: MessageEnv) => void;
  messageWillSend?: (env: MessageEnv) => void;
}
```

#### Example

```ts
import { MessagePlugin } from "@remix-pwa/sw";

class analyticsPlugin implements MessagePlugin = {
  messageDidReceive: (env) => {
    // Send a message to an analytics service
  }
};
```

## `StrategyPlugin`

#### Remarks

- The strategy plugin is an interface that is implemented to add extra functionality to your Service Worker caching strategies.
- It contains methods that allow for implementation at multiple points in the caching lifecycle.
- You can also call these methods when you are extending a strategy to implement additional functionality like logging, rate limiting, compression, encryption, etc. The limit is the skies here ðŸš€!

#### Definition

```ts
interface StrategyPlugin {
  requestWillFetch?: (options: { request: Request; event?: ExtendableEvent }) => Promise<Request>;

  fetchDidFail?: (options: {
    request: Request;
    error: Error;
    event?: ExtendableEvent;
  }) => Promise<void | null | undefined>;

  cacheWillUpdate?: (options: {
    request: Request;
    response: Response;
    event?: ExtendableEvent;
  }) => Promise<Response | void | null | undefined>;

  cacheDidUpdate?: (options: {
    cacheName: string;
    request: Request;
    oldResponse?: Response;
    newResponse: Response;
    event?: ExtendableEvent;
  }) => Promise<void>;

  cachedResponseWillBeUsed?: (options: {
    cacheName: string;
    request: Request;
    matchOptions: CacheQueryMatchOptions;
    cachedResponse: Response;
    event?: ExtendableEvent;
  }) => Promise<Response | null | void | undefined>;

  cacheDidDelete?: (options: {
    cacheName: string;
    request?: Request;
    cachedResponse?: Response;
    matchOptions?: CacheQueryMatchOptions;
  }) => Promise<void>;

  fetchDidStart?: (options: { request: Request }) => Promise<void>;

  fetchDidReceive?: (options: { request: Request; response: Response }) => Promise<Response>;

  fetchDidSucceed?: (options: { request: Request; response: Response; event?: ExtendableEvent }) => Promise<Response>;

  cachedResponseIsValid?: (options: {
    cacheName: string;
    request: Request;
    matchOptions: CacheQueryMatchOptions;
    cachedResponse: Response;
  }) => Promise<boolean>;

  responseShouldBeCached?: (options: { request: Request; response: Response }) => Promise<boolean>;

  cacheableFetchDidFetch?: (options: { request: Request }) => Promise<Response>;

  cacheHasExpired?: (options: {
    cacheName: string;
    matchOptions: CacheQueryMatchOptions;
    cachedResponse: Response;
    request: Request;
    event?: ExtendableEvent;
  }) => Promise<boolean> | boolean;

  cacheWillExpire?: (options: { cache: Cache }) => Promise<void> | void;

  cachesWillExpire?: (options: { cacheNames: string[] }) => Promise<void> | void;
}
```

- The `requestWillFetch` method is called when a request is about to be fetched.
- The `fetchDidFail` method is called when a request fails to fetch.
- The `cacheWillUpdate` method is called when a request is about to be cached.
- The `cacheDidUpdate` method is called when a request has been cached.
- The `cachedResponseWillBeUsed` method is called when a cached response is about to be used.
- The `cacheDidDelete` method is called when a cached response is deleted.
- The `fetchDidStart` method is called when a request starts to fetch.
- The `fetchDidReceive` method is called when a request receives a response.
- The `fetchDidSucceed` method is called when a request successfully fetches a response.
- The `cachedResponseIsValid` method is called when a cached response is about to be used.
- The `responseShouldBeCached` method is called when a response is about to be cached.
- The `cacheableFetchDidFetch` method is called when a request is about to be fetched.
- The `cacheHasExpired` method is called when a cached response has expired.
- The `cacheWillExpire` method is called when a cached response is about to expire.
- The `cachesWillExpire` method is called when a cache is about to expire.

<Info>
If you think there is another instance in a cache lifecycle missed out on, or maybe you want to add a new lifecycle, please check out the [contribution](/pwa/contribute) section to see how you can contribute.

#### Example

The following example shows how to implement a strategy plugin that logs the request and response of every request.

```ts
import { StrategyPlugin } from "@remix-pwa/sw";

class loggingPlugin implements StrategyPlugin = {
  fetchDidReceive: (options) => {
    console.log(options.request);
    console.log(options.response);
  }
};
```
