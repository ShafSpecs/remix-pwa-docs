The `useSWEffect` hook allows you to monitor and handle navigation events in your Remix application. 
It is similar to the `useEffect` hook, but it is only called when the user navigates to a new page in your application.

This hook is to be used exclusively in your `root` file. 

```ts 
// app/root.tsx
import { useSWEffect } from "@remix-pwa/sw";

// at the yop of your root component 
useSWEffect();
```
