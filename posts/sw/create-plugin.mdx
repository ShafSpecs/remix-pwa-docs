Plugins are used to extend a lot of things in Remix PWA. Generally, `@remix-pwa/sw` uses a super, abstract class - inherited classes to implement several features. 
For example, caching strategies use this approach. To extend the behaviour of a strategy (like add a background sysnc feature), you can create a plugin and plug it into the strategy directly 
at initialisation.

## Creating a Plugin

To create a plugin, you need to extend the `Plugin` interface of whatever you want to extend. 
For example, if you want to extend `CacheStrategy` behaviour, you need to extend the `StrategyPlugin` interface.

```ts
import { StrategyPlugin } from '@remix-pwa/sw';

export class MyStrategyPlugin extends StrategyPlugin {
  // implement the methods you want to override
}
```

## Plugging a Plugin

To plug a plugin functionality in, you only need to pass it to during instantiation and that's all.

```ts
import { NetworkFirst } from '@remix-pwa/sw';
import { MyStrategyPlugin } from './my-strategy-plugin';

const customPlugin = new MyStrategyPlugin();

const customNetworkStrategy = new NetworkFirst({
  cacheName: 'custom-network-strategy',
  plugins: [customPlugin]
});
```

And you can use your strategy as usual in your service worker.

## Plugin Lifecycle

Plugins have a lifecycle that is called by the strategy. Check out the [plugin reference](/sw/plugin-reference) for more info.
