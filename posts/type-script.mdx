Remix PWA seamlessly supports TypeScript. Supporting a TypeScript-first workflow as a core design principle of Remix PWA.

The Remix PWA compiler doesn't need any extra configuration to support TypeScript. Just name your files with the `.ts` or `.tsx` extension and you're good to go
(don't forget to update your `remix.config.js` as needed).

That's all! Too short? Well, there's not much to say. We love TypeScript!
