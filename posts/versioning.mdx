## Versioning

### What is versioning?

Versioning is a way to keep track of changes to your application. It is a way to know what changes were made, when they were made, and who made them. 
It is also a way to revert back to a previous version of your application if needed.

### How does versioning work in Remix PWA?

You might have noticed this article continously refer to the update as Remix PWA v3.0, whilst the versions of the `@remix-pwa/*` packages are
all `2.x.x`. This is because Remix PWA adopted a two-way versioning system. Meaning there are two versions for every major update that comes out.

A little bit of history, dim the lights please 💡! Remix PWA started out as a simple executable that scaffolds the app for you. It copied stuffs from a predefined template
and pasted it into your application. Said bye-bye and you were on your own to grow the PWA from there. That was the v0.x.x (alpha and beta stages) and also v1.x.x (stable stage).

Then came v2.x.x. This was a major update. It introduced a lot of new features and also a set of packages for doing multiple things. This was just `@remix-pwa/sw` and `@remix-pwa/push`
but nonetheless, it was a major update. The packages were released as `1.x.x` (one major version lower than the actual executable).

Now, v3.0 is here. Another major update, probably the biggest of them all and it follows the same convention, the `remix-pwa` executable is `3.x.x` and the packages are `2.x.x`,
even those that were just released (e.g `@remix-pwa/dev`).

That's it! That's how versioning works in Remix PWA 👋.
