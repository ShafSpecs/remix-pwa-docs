## `useSWEffect`

useSWEffect is a React hook that sends updates to the Worker thread whenever relevant changes are made to the main thread (browser).

By default, the worker thread knows nothing about what's going on in the main thread, wether navigation or routing. This hook
bridges that by providing regular updates based on `location` changes (`useLocation` hook). 

```tsx {{ filename:'root.tsx' }}
import { useSWEffect } from '@remix-run/sw'

export default function App() {
  useSWEffect();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```
