## Installation

To get started with `remix-pwa` in your application, run:

```bash
npx remix-pwa@latest
```

This would install the CLI that can then be used to scaffold a new Remix PWA application quickly.

### CLI Usage

Run the following command to see the available options and flags:

```bash
npx remix-pwa@latest -h
```

When you run the CLI in a new project, a set of questions would be asked in order to whip up a suitable template.

- **Is this a TS or JS Project:** Wether to use `ts` or `js` files in your application.
- **Caching Strategy:** Wether to use precaching or not (Just-In-Time caching).
- **PWA Features you want:** The available features are:
  - Service Worker
  - Web Manifest
  - Push Notifications
  - Client Utilities (Offline, Network, etc.)
  - Development Icons
- **Workbox Integration**: If you selected service workers above, do you want to integrate workbox?
- **Location of your app folder:** By defalt, it is `app`. But if you changed it (e.g `src`), then indicate so. (*Without any trailing slashes*)
- **Immediately install dependencies:** If you want to install dependencies immediately after scaffolding.
