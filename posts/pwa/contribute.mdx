## Contributing to Remix PWA

We welcome contributions to Remix PWA! We can't be where we are or accomplish what we do without the wonderful community. We appreciate your help!

This post is to help you familiarize yourself with the process and start contributing to Remix PWA.

**Please read this before attempting to make a contribution to any package.**

## Roles

There are two roles in the Remix PWA project:

- **Admins** are team members responsible for the overall health of the project. They are the ones who with admin rights, create releases and manage the roadmap.
- **Maintainers** are team members responsible for reviewing and merging pull requests. They have write access to the repositories.
- **Contributors** are anyone who contributes to the project. This includes opening issues, opening pull requests, and commenting on issues and pull requests. In short, you!

## Development Process 

### Feature Development 

If you want to create a new feature/module for `remix-pwa`, please don't directly open a pull request. 
Instead, follow this process:

1. Create a [Github discussion](https://github.com/orgs/remix-pwa/discussions), outlining the feature you want to add. This allows for refinement, corrections and discussion anyone starts coding.
2. Once a discussion is approved, an issue would be created to keep track of it.
3. Depending on the nature of the request, it would be added to the [roadmap](/pwa/roadmap).
4. An assignee (or multiple) would then be assigned to the issue. Who would keep track, and help prepare the feature.
5. Once the feature is ready, a PR can then be opened, tracked and reviewing would happen.
6. If the green light is given, a merge occurs!

### Bug-fix Pull Requests

No software is perfect including this one, so if you've found a bug, we'd love a PR! Follow these guidelines to ensure a swift merge:

1. Create an issue describing the bug. If you can, include a link to a reproduction repo or provide code snippets.
2. Make sure to explain the bug, how to reproduce it and your proposed fix.

### Bug Repost Issues 

If you've found a bug but don't have the time to fix it or can't find a solution, we'd still love to hear about it! Follow these guidelines when reporting:

1. Create an issue describing the bug. If you can, include a link to a reproduction repo or provide code snippets to reproduce it.
2. Make sure to explain the issue well and how to reproduce it using explanatory terms.
3. If you have a proposed fix but can't create a PR, please include it in the issue.
