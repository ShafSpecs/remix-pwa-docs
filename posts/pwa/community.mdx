## Remix Community

The Remix PWA community isn't a separate community, but one embedded into the Remix community. A community that's all about devs hanging out
and having fun while building cool stuff for the web.

## Support 

### Discord

The [Remix Discord server](https://rmx.as/discord) is the best place to get help, chat about ideas, approaches and generally anything. A lot 
of the Remix community are also quite active in there (including me, don't be afraid to ping!).

### Github Discussions

Github discussion forum is also another great place to converse with the team and other Remix devs about anything Remix/PWA related. 
We are always happy to help.

### StackOverflow 

If you have a question that you think might be useful to others, or you want to get help from the wider community, StackOverflow is a great place to ask questions.

### Definitely not Twitter

Heading is enough...

## Contributing

Wanna help? That's cool, we always appreciate contributions even if its just typos or grammar fixes. Head over to the [contribution page](/pwa/contribute) to see how 
you can render your help.
