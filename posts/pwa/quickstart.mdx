## Getting up and ready 

After [installing `remix-pwa`](/pwa/installation), the next step is to actually get it up and running.

A few things that the CLI did for use was to create a new entry file for us, a manifest route (the names of these files might differ based on your choices) 
and some new files in a `utils` directory, modified our `package.json` and added a new set of icons in `public/icons`. Not shabby at all.

We still have work to do though, currently our Remix app has no idea about the existence of a worker and the worker has no idea 
about anything going on in the Remix application. Quite a mess!

### Linking the Worker

Fixing the first issue is not difficult, head over to `entry.client.tsx` and plug in the following (short) code:

```ts
import { loadServiceWorker } from "@remix-pwa/sw";

// change the name if yours is something else
// Note the `.js` extension!!!
loadServiceWorker({
  serviceWorkerUrl: "/entry.worker.js"
});
```

Great! Now our application can actually locate our worker file 
and if we open up the "Application" tab in the browser, and navigate to the Service Worker tab, 
we actually see our service worker. But we still have a problem, no caching is happening 
and if we go offline, our app goes offline with us (*a lot of errors also included*). 

We need to inform the worker file of events and stuffs (like navigation) happening in the app. Can be solved with a hook luckily.
Add this line to your `root.tsx` (remember to import from `@remix-pwa/sw`):

```ts 
// Add at the top of your main, root component
useSWEEffect();
```

And like that, we have a PWA. 

### Linking our Manifest 

Currently, our manifest file is also not recognised. That's because we didn't link anything yet.
It's also not difficult to solve, add the right above Remix `<Links>` component in your `root`:

```html 
<!-- Notice I used Remix `v2_routeConvention`, change if not using -->
<link rel="manifest" href="/resources.manifest.webmanifest" />
```

And we have a good-to-go PWA set up! Check out the rest of the docs to explore the endless possibilities!
