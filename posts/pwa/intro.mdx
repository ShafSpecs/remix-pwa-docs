## Overview

Remix PWA is a lightweight, standalone npm package that adds full Progressive Web App support to Remix 💿.

### Installation

To get started with `remix-pwa`, use the command:

```sh
npx remix-pwa@latest
```

To get additional info about installation and the CLI, check out the [installation](/pwa/installation) section.

## Features

- **One-stop for everything PWA**: Integrate Progressive Web App (PWA) features into Remix including offline support, caching, installability on native devices and more.
- **Speed up your builds by caching large resources**: Automatic caching for `build` files and static files, it's customisable and on the house!
- **Take caching to the next level**: Now ships with multiple caching strategies to customise your user experience down to the last word. Don't like what we have? Oh, you can build yours too!
- **Error handling is a nice-to-have**: Safely handles uncached loader calls without affecting other sections of the site (e.g throws user to nearest Error boundary without disrupting application)
- **Native to the moon 🚀**: Native APIs to help give your Remix web application the native feel it deserves.
- **Extensibility**: Remix PWA is built to be extensible, so you can add your own custom caching strategies, native APIs and more. 
- **Modular**: The new `remix-pwa` isn't bundled together no more. It is now built from modular packages that together would give you the best PWA experience you can get.
- **Plugins**: *Pssst*, that's right. Remix PWA extensibility just hit next level 🔥. We are saying no more, as you would soon see!
