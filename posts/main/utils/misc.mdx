`@remix-pwa/sw` ships with a multitude of utilities to help you build your Service Worker and extend its capabilities.

## `isLoaderRequest`

The `isLoaderRequest` function allows you to check if a request is a loader request. It takes in the request as it's sole argument.

## `isActionRequest`

The `isActionRequest` function allows you to check if a request is an action request. It takes in the request as it's sole argument.

## `isDocumentRequest`

The `isDocumentRequest` function allows you to check if a request is a document request. Note, this only detects client-side navigation requests.
To detect document requests as well, check out the `useSWEffect` hook

## `sendSkipWaitingMessage` ðŸ†•

A utility to send a `SKIP_WAITING` message to a Worker. Takes in one argument, the `ServiceWorker` to send the message to.

## `timeout`

A simple sleep function that resolves after a given time.

## `isHttpRequest`

The `isHttpRequest` function allows you to check if a request is an HTTP request. It takes in the request (or a url) as it's sole argument.

> You'd be surprised to see service workers intercepting requests made by browser extensions. A good safeguard really.

## `toJSON`

The `toJSON` function allows you to convert a response object to a JSON object. Don't worry, it clones your response object before converting it.

## `unregisterServiceWorker`

If for some reason, you get fed up with your service worker and decide to not use it again, you can unregister it using the `unregisterServiceWorker` function.

## `loadServiceWorker`

The old classic! Allows you to manually register your service worker, be sure to disable `registerSW` in your vite config file first.
