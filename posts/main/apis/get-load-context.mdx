The `getLoadContext` function is another handler within the entry service worker that allows you to create a global context object for the worker thread.

The output of this function is what determines what your `context` object would look anywhere within the various worker APIs that utilizes it. It takes in the fetch event object as its lone argument and should return an object.

The `context` object by default, contains the following:

- **`event`**: The fetch event object that triggered the worker.
- **`fetchFromServer`**: A function utility that allows you to fetch the request (forward the request to the server).

If no `getLoadContext` function is provided or is defined, but an empty object (`{}`) is returned, the default `context` object would be used.

In the other case where a non-empty object is returned, the default `context` object would be merged with the object returned by the `getLoadContext` function.

<Warn>
  Note that this means you can override both `event` and `fetchFromServer` if you return an object with the same keys in your `getLoadContext` function. I won't recommend overriding `event` by the way.
</Warn>

Here's an example of how you can use the `getLoadContext` function:

```tsx {{filename:'entry.worker.ts'}}
export const getLoadContext = (event: FetchEvent) => {
  return {
    unStrippedRequest: event.request,
    fetchFromServer: async (request: Request) => {
      return await fetch(request)
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, we override the `fetchFromServer` property of the default `context` object with a custom function that more or less does the same thing. And we also provided a new property `unStrippedRequest` that contains the original request object. The `context` object now available globally within the worker thread would now contain three properties: `event`, `fetchFromServer`, and `unStrippedRequest`.

This can be extended to share cache objects, stores, or any other data you might want to share globally between your workers in your routes and the entry service worker.

<Info>
  Typings are not provided for the `context` object, so if utilizing TypeScript, I would very much advise you to create a type definition for your `context` object that you can then import across your app.
