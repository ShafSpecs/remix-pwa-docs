description: "Your default handler for fetching requests in your Service Worker."
alternateTitle: defaultFetchHandler
---
In a normal client-server architecture, the client makes a request to the server, and the server responds with the requested data. When a Service Worker is introduced, there is a middleman between the client and the server. That intercepts requests and responses coming from both ends and forward it to the other end.

That interception in the Service Worker is done by the `fetch` event. The `fetch` event is triggered whenever a request is made from the client. The Service Worker can intercept this request and respond with the data from a data source (could be the server, a cache storage, or any other source).

In Remix PWA, the fetch event is handled implicitly (behind-the-scenes) by runtimes, so you don't get to listen to the fetch event directly. Instead, you can define a `defaultFetchHandler` export in your service worker file that would be used to handle (*almost all*) fetch requests.

<Info>
  The `defaultFetchHandler` is basically a fallback handler that is used when no appropriate handler is found in a route.

  Route handlers in this case, or as we like to call them: route worker apis, are simply [`workerAction`](/docs/main/worker-action) and [`workerLoader`](/docs/main/worker-loader) exports in your routes that handle non-`GET` and `GET` requests respectively.
</Info>

## Usage

### Using the defaultFetchHandler

`defaultFetchHandler` should be defined in your service worker file, as mentioned earlier, they are the first fallback handler for all fetch requests.

```tsx {{ filename: 'entry.worker.ts' }}
import type { WorkerDataFunctionArgs } from '@remix-pwa/dev';

export const defaultFetchHandler = async ({
  request
}: WorkerDataFunctionArgs) => {
  const serverHost = 'https://api.example.com';
  const url = new URL(request.url);

  if (request.method.toLowercase() === 'get' && url.searchParams.get('_data'))
    return fetch(`${serverHost}${url.pathname}`);

  return fetch(request);
}
```

In this little snippet, we are defining a `defaultFetchHandler` that intercepts data (loader) requests and forwards them to an external
server that maps the same path as the request.

<Warn>
  You should note that like Remix server functions, you **must** return a response from the `defaultFetchHandler`. Unlike
  Remix case where a simple `null` would suffice, you must return a `Response` object in the Service Worker.

  Unlike Remix server functions, the `defaultFetchHandler` intercepts **every** fetch request, so you should always make sure to validate and vet
  the requests before acting on them. And by default, just forward the request to the server (`fetch(request)`).
</Warn>

<Details title="What happens if I don't provide a default fetch handler?">
  Well, in that case, it depends on the [runtime](/docs/main/runtimes). If you are using `@remix-pwa/worker-runtime`, the underlying behaviour is to just utilise a simple
  `fetch` call to the server. As you can see, this behaviour is heavily dependent on the runtime, so you can customise it to suit your needs.

## Arguments

### `request`

Remix PWA APIs are built to be as close as possible to Remix existing APIs. The `request` object is the fetch request originating from
the client.

> Note: Like Remix server functions, the request object being passed is a stripped down version of the actual request, if you would like
> to access the full request object, you can use the `context` object (`context.event.request`).

### `context`

The `context` object is a global context object being passed around your service worker.

<Info>
  With Remix PWA, you should stop thinking of your Service Worker as just the entry worker file but as your whole application. Every `workerLoader`
  and `workerAction` is a part of your Service Worker.
  
  Since they're spread across multiple files, the `context` object is a global object that is passed around and allows for
  sharing of data and state between them.
</Info>

Creation of the `context` object is handled via the [`getLoadContext`](/docs/main/get-load-context) function in your entry worker file.

### `params`

The `params` object is the same as that utilised by Remix server functions.
