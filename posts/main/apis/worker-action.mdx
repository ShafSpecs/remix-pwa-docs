Remix PWA introduced route worker apis in v3 for intercepting and handling non-GET requests uniquely within a route. The flow is simple, where you have an [`action`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/action), you have a `workerAction` in front of it.

## workerAction

### Synopsis

Sometimes, when handling specific routes in the worker, you might want to run some particular code for that route. For example, within a news app, you might want to have a background sync function that is able to get the lastest news for the
user as soon as the user comes online, even when the app is closed. Typically, you would do that within your service worker,
utilising good old `switch` statements to match your routes.

With `workerAction`, you can easily create and isolate worker functionalities for various routes within your app, whilst still being able to share and pass state around the worker. It is indeed glorious!

### Usage

`workerAction` are used like your typical route modules, you export the function, make sure to return a response, and you're good to go. On a more serious note, they are quite very similar to `action`.

```tsx {{filename:'app/routes/todos.tsx'}}
import type { WorkerActionArgs } from "@remix-pwa/sw";
import type { ActionFunctionArgs } from "@remix-run/node";
import { json, redirect } from "@remix-run/node";
import { Form } from "@remix-run/react";

import { TodoList } from "~/components/TodoList";
import { fakeCreateTodo, fakeGetTodos } from "~/utils/db";

export async function action({
  request,
}: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  const body = await request.formData();
  const todo = await fakeCreateTodo({
    title: body.get("title"),
  });
  return redirect(`/todos/${todo.id}`);
}

export async workerAction({ context }: WorkerActionArgs) {
  const { fetchFromServer } = context;
  let response;

  try {
    response = await fetchFromServer();
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    await queueToServer({
      name: "todoSync",
      request: event.request.clone()
    });
  }

  if (response && response.ok) return response // would redirect
  
  return json({ message: "Network error occured! Waiting for network..." })
}

export async function loader() {
  return json(await fakeGetTodos());
}

export default function Todos() {
  const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader>();
  const { message } = useActionData<typeof workerAction>();
  return (
    <div>
      <TodoList todos={data} />
      <Form method="post">
        <input type="text" name="title" />
        <button type="submit">Create Todo</button>
      </Form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, we adapted the code from Remix [action page](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/action) to include a `workerAction` that would save the request to indexedDB if network error occurs, and keep retrying until the network is back.

### `workerActionArgs`

`workerAction` receives an object with the following properties:

- `context` - The worker global context object that's created via [`getLoadContext`](/docs/main/get-load-context) in your entry worker.
- `params` - The route `params` properties. Matches dynamic routes, check out Remix docs for more info.
- `request` - The request object.

### `workerAction` vs `action`

The `workerAction` differ from `action` based on where they run and what they can do. The `workerAction` runs on the worker thread and can only do things that the worker thread can do (can't run server-side content, for example) while the `action` runs on the server and can only do things that the server can do (can't run client-side content, for example).

Simply put, `workerAction` runs within the worker thread, while `action` runs within your server. Asides from that, they are pretty much the same.

The possibilities for `workerAction` are plenty, including augmenting `clientAction` - serving as your server. Or straight up being used to further enhance your app's offline capabilities and user experience.
