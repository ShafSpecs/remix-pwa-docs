Like all things in life, there are some nopesies and ah-ahs that you should be very aware of when using Remix PWA.

Introducing a compiler, a runtime, route worker functions and many more could potentially lead some to take some hazardous routes/shortcuts/decisions that break the app unintentionally. And as I like to say:

> If you're going to break it, break it good!

Sorry, not that quote. I meant:

> A broken service worker is worse than no service worker at all.

Your Service Worker acts as an intermediary, a server of sorts to your client. Break that and your client becomes a sad, unusable panda. To avoid that outcome, here are a few surprises to take note of.

## Never override `fetch`

Can't state this enough. The `fetch` event is an important event in a Service Worker's lifecycle. As part of the Remix PWA ecosystem, the handling of the `fetch` event is delegated to runtimes (or entry workers) that are responsible for not just handling events from the user worker, but route worker apis as well (`workerLoader`/`workerAction`).

Overriding this can lead to some disastrous results. So, please, don't do it. If you want to customise it, feel free to build a custom runtime that does exactly what you want.

## `workerLoader` behaviour

This is another one. The `workerLoader` don't run on initial loads anymore, a process that I am still trying to optimise. They currently load on client-side navigations only (which are subsequent navigations after first load). If you want to force them to run on first load, you can via Remix `useRevalidator` hook. Hook it up in your app `root` route, and use a `useEffect`, revalidate on first render

```tsx {{filename:'app.tsx'}}
import { useRevalidator } from "@remix-run/react";
import { useEffect } from "react";

export default function App() {
  const revalidator = useRevalidator();

  useEffect(() => {
    revalidator.revalidate();
  }, []);

  // Rest of your app
}
```

## Caching non-`GET` requests

Simply put, you can't. The `Cache API` is built to handle only `GET` requests and not built to handle the intricacies of other request methods. If you want to cache other request methods, I would recommend taking a look at the `IndexedDB API`. A powerful API that allows you to store data in the browser in a database-like manner.
