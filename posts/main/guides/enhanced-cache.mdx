`EnahncedCache` was built around the idea of providing a cache wrapper that exhibited behaviour (strategy) but could also do a lot more. Without further ado, let's dive into the features of `EnhancedCache`.

## Features

`EnhancedCache` is a class that wraps itself around a [strategy](/docs/main/cache-api#strategies). Let's go ahead and create an enhanced cache instance.

```ts {{filename:'entry.worker.ts'}}
import { EnhancedCache } from '@remix-pwa/sw';

const cache = new EnhancedCache('my-cache', {
  strategy: 'CacheFirst',
  strategyOptions: {}
});
```

Let's explore the constructor signature:

```ts
export type StrategyName = 'CacheFirst' | 'CacheOnly' | 'NetworkFirst' | 'StaleWhileRevalidate';

export type StrategySelection<T> = T extends 'NetworkFirst'
  ? NetworkFriendlyOptions
  : T extends 'StaleWhileRevalidate'
    ? SWROptions
    : CacheFriendlyOptions;

type StrategyWithOptions<T extends StrategyName> = {
  strategy: T;
  strategyOptions: StrategySelection<T>;
};

export type EnhancedCacheOptions = {
  version?: string;
} & (
  | {
      strategy?: never;
      strategyOptions?: never;
    }
  | StrategyWithOptions<'CacheFirst'>
  | StrategyWithOptions<'CacheOnly'>
  | StrategyWithOptions<'NetworkFirst'>
  | StrategyWithOptions<'StaleWhileRevalidate'>
);

new EnhancedCache(cacheName: string, options: EnhancedCacheOptions)
```

It takes in two parameters:

1. `cacheName`: A string that represents the name of the cache.
2. `options`: An object that contains the following properties:
   - `version`: A string that represents the version of the cache. This allows for versioning of the cache.
   - `strategy`: A string that represents the strategy to be used. The available strategies are `CacheFirst`, `CacheOnly`, `NetworkFirst`, and `StaleWhileRevalidate` (the available strategies from `sw` package).
   - `strategyOptions`: An object that contains the options for the strategy. The options are different for each strategy. Check out the strategy [page](/docs/main/cache-api#strategies) for more info.

> Currently, `EnhancedCache` only supports the strategies provided by the `sw` package. Extending it to custom `BaseStrategy` sub-classes is underway.

## Methods

`EnhancedCache` provides a list of public, protected and static methods. Let's explore them in this section.

### `handleRequest`

`EnhancedCache` provides a method `handleRequest` that can be used to handle requests. It is a wrapper around the strategy's own `handleRequest` method. And takes in a `Request` or `URL` or `string` as its lone parameter.

```ts
const response = await cache.handleRequest('https://my-url.com/something');
```

### `addToCache`

This method allows you to add a response to the cache. It takes in a `Request` or `URL` or `string` and a `Response` as its parameters. Like all cache mutation processes in Remix PWA, this one ensures the headers for validation and cleanup are in order before commiting it to the cache.

```ts
const response = await fetch('https://example.com/1');

await cache.addToCache('https://example.com/1', response);
```

### `removeFromCache`

The opposite of `addToCache`, this method allows you to remove a response from the cache. It takes in a `Request` or `URL` or `string` as its lone parameter.

```ts
await cache.removeFromCache('https://example.com/1');
```

### `match`

This method allows you to match a request against the cache. It takes in a `Request` or `URL` or `string` as its lone parameter. And returns the response from the cache, or `undefined` if it doesn't exist.

```ts
const response = await cache.match('https://example.com/1');
```

### `clearCache`

This method allows you to clear the cache. It takes in no parameters and returns a `Promise` that resolves when the cache is cleared.

```ts
await cache.clearCache();
```

### `getCacheEntries`

This method allows you to get all the cache entries. It takes in no parameters and returns a `Promise` that resolves with an array of cache entries (the request and response).

```ts
const entries = await cache.getCacheEntries();

// The response has this format:
// [
//   {
//     request: Request,
//     response: Response
//   },
//   ...
// ]
```

### `getCacheStats`

This method allows you to get some helpful information about your cache. It takes in no parameters and returns a `Promise` that resolves with an object containing the following properties of the following signature:

```ts
type CacheStats = {
  length: number;
  totalSize: number;
  cacheDistribution: Record<string, number>;
  cacheHitRatio: number;
  cacheEfficiency: number;
  averageCacheAge: number;
  cacheCompressionRatio: number;
};
```

where:

- `length`: The total number of items in the cache.
- `totalSize`: The total size of items in the cache (in kilobytes).
- `cacheDistribution`: The distribution of cache items by content type (in percentages).
- `cacheHitRatio`: The hit ratio of the cache. The ratio of cache hits to total requests.
- `cacheEfficiency`: The efficiency of the cache. The ratio of cache hits to the total size of the cache (in percentage).
- `averageCacheAge`: The average age of items in the cache (in seconds).
- `cacheCompressionRatio`: The ratio of the total size of compressed cached resources to the total size of uncompressed cached resources (in percentage).

```ts
const stats = await cache.getCacheStats();
```

### `preCacheUrls`

This method allows you to pre-cache a list of URLs (cache more than one request at once). It takes in an array of `Request` or `URL` or `string` as its lone parameter.

```ts
await cache.preCacheUrls([
  'https://example.com/1',
  'https://example.com/2',
  'https://example.com/3'
]);
```

## Static Methods

### `purgeCache`

This is like the `clearCache`, but with selective cache removal. It takes in the cache object and a callback function that returns a boolean. The callback function is used to determine which cache entries to remove.

```ts
type CacheEntry = { request: Request; response: Response | undefined }

purgeCache(cache: EnhancedCache, callback: (entry: CacheEntry) => boolean): Promise<void>
```

```ts
await EnhancedCache.purgeCache(cache, (entry) => {
  return entry.request.url.includes('old_asset');
});
```

This method can be combined with a few other static and non-static methods to provide a powerful cache filtering and removal mechanism.

### `visualizeCache`

This method allows you to visualize the cache. It takes in the cache object as its sole parameter and returns a `Promise` that resolves with a object (of type `unknown`) containing the visualization of the cache in a tree-like format.

```ts
const visualization = await EnhancedCache.visualizeCache(cache);
```

### `compressResponse`

This method allows you to compress a response. It takes in a `Response` as its lone parameter and returns a `Promise` that resolves with a `Response` that is compressed.

The response returned by this method is a `Response` with the `Content-Encoding` header set to `gzip` and the body compressed.

```ts
const response = await fetch('https://example.com/1');

const compressedResponse = await EnhancedCache.compressResponse(response);
```

### `decompressResponse`

This method allows you to decompress a response. It takes in a `Response` as its lone parameter and returns a `Promise` that resolves with a `Response` that is decompressed.

### `persistCache`

This allows you to persist a cache at any given moment to IndexedDB. It takes in the cache object and the store name as its parameters.

```ts
await EnhancedCache.persistCache(cache, 'my-cache-store');
```

> Think of it like a snapshot (of the cache at that moment in time) mechanism.

### `restoreCache`

This allows you to restore a cache from IndexedDB. It takes in the cache object and the store name and an optional `restoreTtl` (default: false) as its parameters.

The `restoreTtl` method allows you to restore the cache with the original TTL (time-to-live) header values. If set to `false`, the cache will be restored with the TTL set to the current time (as if you just cached it).

```ts
await EnhancedCache.restoreCache(cache, 'my-cache-store', restoreTtl: true);
```

## Forbidden Methods

This section contains methods that seem exposed but should not be used except you know what you are doing.

### `__putInCache`

This method is used internally by the `EnhancedCache` class to put a response in the cache. It takes in a `Request` and a `Response` as its parameters. The difference between this and `addToCache` is that this method does not ensure the headers for validation and cleanup are in place. So, utilising this would tend to mess up cache cleanup operations.
