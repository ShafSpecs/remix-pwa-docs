My goal for Remix PWA is to be an open platform that provides tools for developers to build Progressive Web Apps with Remix. Remix PWA after all, is a community project (thanks to y'all ðŸ¥°)!

## How to contribute

The main process for contributing to Remix PWA, wether the docs, a typo fix, hotfix, or a new feature, is as follows:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch
3. Make your changes
4. Push your changes to your fork
5. Create a pull request

Depending on the nature of your contribution, your PR destination might differ a bit. Here are the main respositories and how the inter-connect:

- **[`remix-pwa`](https://github.com/remix-pwa/remix-pwa)**: This repository is currently the front-face of Remix PWA. It houses the main `remix-pwa` executable and was previously the main repository for the project.
- **[`remix-pwa-docs`](https://github.com/ShafSpecs/remix-pwa-docs)**: This repository houses the documentation for Remix PWA. It is a separate repository from the main Remix PWA repository to allow for easier management of the documentation. The documentation is based on the [Journal Stack](https://github.com/ShafSpecs/journal-stack) ðŸ˜„.
- **[`monorepo`](https://github.com/remix-pwa/monorepo)**: Weird name, I know. This repository is a monorepo that houses the main powerhouse of Remix PWA. From the main CLI engine to core packages like `@remix-pwa/dev`, `@remix-pwa/sw`, etc. They are all stored under the `packages` directory. It also contains a sandbox (`playground`) for free-styling and breaking stuffs locally without worryong about breaking the main project.

Currently, these are the main repositories for Remix PWA. If any new ones pop up, would update the list here.

### Bug fixes

If you find a bug in Remix PWA, please open an issue on the repository. If you can fix the bug, please follow the steps above to create a pull request.

### New features

If you have a new idea/feature you very much would love to see in Remix PWA, please **do not** just go ahead and start coding. Create a new RFC (Request for Change/Comments) discussion under the main Remix PWA [discussions tab](https://github.com/orgs/remix-pwa/discussions) to discuss the feature. This is to ensure that the feature aligns with the goals of Remix PWA and to get feedback from the community.

### Documentation

If you find a typo, error, or something that needs to be updated in the documentation, please follow the steps above to create a pull request. You can create a PR right away and make a PR to the `remix-pwa-docs` repository (*`main` branch, please*).

## Branches

This section is imperative when dealing with the `monorepo` repository. Quite a workflow has been setup to automate the development and release process (thanks [Sarabadu](https://github.com/Sarabadu) and [Luciano](https://github.com/lfantone) ðŸ’–), and due to that. Random PRs can't be popping off to any branch.

There are two main branches in the `monorepo` repository at any given momoent:

- `main`: This is the main branch of the repository. It is the branch that is used to create new releases (under the `latest`). This branch is never meant to be touched by contributors, as activites on this branch are automated via workflows.
- `dev`: The `dev` branch is the branch PRs should be made to. It is the main branch where all prep work is done before a new release is made (a PR to `main` from here). This repo also uses [`semantic-release`](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io) to handle the release process, so based on the commit type and scope, a pre-release might be made.

<Details title="What are pre-releases?">
  Pre-releases are releases that we also like to call nightly release. They are released under the `dev` tag on npm. And their version numbers appear in this fashion: `x.x.x-dev.x`. Multiple pre-releases might be happen (based on feedbacks) before a final release is made.
