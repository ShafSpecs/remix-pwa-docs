Remix PWA does not do anything to or with environment variables (mostly). In Remix PWA, the `process` object is not available (as service workers run in the client), and as such, accessing them directly is not possible.

However, Remix PWA isn't unaware of some of these variables. The main and only one being `NODE_ENV`, this variable is used to determine the state for which the service worker is bundled. As a `production` value will bundle the service worker with optimizations and less exposed stuffs (like `Logger`s), while a `development` value will bundle the service worker with full utilities to help you debug and develop.

You can also utilise `process.env.NODE_ENV` (in that order) within your service worker as Remix PWA would handle substituting the value for you at compilation time.

## Custom Variables

Currently, Remix PWA doesn't offer up a way to access/set custom environment variables within the service worker. This should hopefully be rolling out in a future patch (*higher demand means it rolls out quicker ðŸ˜‰*).
