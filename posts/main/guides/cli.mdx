Remix PWA CLI also got a big upgrade in this update. Much smaller, faster and more concise, the CLI (an ever-evolving tool) is more powerful than ever when it comes to supporting your PWA development workflow.

Remix PWA v4 did away with esbuild, and so did our approach to the CLI. No more `remix-pwa init` or the likes, everything related to build and development has been transferred to the Vite plugin. The CLI now focuses on providing a quick and easy way to scaffold bits and pieces of your PWA, like a new service worker and a new manifest.

Currently, there are only two main supported commands:

- `manifest`: Scaffold a new web manifest resource route for you. With full typings included ;)
- `sw`: Scaffold a very basic service worker for you. Doesn't add more boilerplate than needed 👍.

## `manifest`

Generate a web manifest file.

Accepts one of two arguments (one of two, not both!):

- `--js`: Generate a JavaScript file with the manifest object.
- `--ts`: Generate a TypeScript file with the manifest object (default).
- `--dest`: Alias: `-d`. The destination directory for the manifest file (defaults to: `./app/routes/manifest[.webmanifest].ts`)

```sh
remix-pwa manifest # defaults to `--ts` behvaiour

remix-pwa manifest --js # generate a JavaScript file

remix-pwa manifest --dest app/pwa/manifest.ts # writes the manifest to `./app/pwa/manifest.ts` directory
```

> Note, it resolves the destination path relative to `process.cwd()`.

<Info>
  Scaffolding a manifest is different from registering a manifest. Ensure to still provide a relevant `link` in your
  `head` tag. Or use the `<ManifestLink />` component 😉
</Info>

## `sw`

Generate a service worker file. Alias: `service-worker`.

Accepts one of the following arguments:

- `--js`: Generate a JavaScript file with the service worker.
- `--dest`: Alias: `-d`. The destination directory for the service worker file (defaults to: `./app/entry.worker.ts`)

```sh
remix-pwa sw # generates a basic TypeScript service worker

remix-pwa sw --js # generates a basic JavaScript service worker

remix-pwa sw --dest app/pwa/service-worker.ts # writes the service worker to `./app/pwa/service-worker.ts` directory
```

> Note, Service Workers are Typescript by default in Remix PWA.

<Info>
  If changing the destination for service workers, ensure to update the Vite plugin accordingly.

I hope to bump up the available commands in the future. If you have any task that you feel is repetitive when setting up, or just a new command/feature for the CLI. Feel free to create a discussion or open an issue.
