One of the many perks of Service Workers is the ability to provide offline capabilities to a web app, giving your users access to your application even in their downtime. In this guide, we would be building just that, a basic offline app.

This is a practical guide, you can choose to code along or take notes. Let's be looking at the app we would be building.

## Getting Started

### Noter App

Noter App (what I am naming this app - pronounced `ËˆnÉ™ÊŠtÉ™`) is a basic note & checklist app that stores notes in a database, notes can vary too. You could have plain text ones (normal notes), or checklists that you can cross off tasks. That's the main premise of Noter App.

It is inspired by [Notein](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=notes.notepad.checklist.calendar.todolist.notebook), a simple, yet effective note taking app I use myself for jotting. The layout would be inspired by [this Dribble design](https://dribbble.com/shots/21350531-Notes-Mobile-App) made by [Fatemeh Siraj](https://dribbble.com/seraj-uix).

### Initializing Noter

Let's kick things off, Something to keep in mind as we begin:

> This guide would gloss over details like styling, layouts, etc. Focusing mainly on the Service Worker part

Like every other Remix project out there, we start by actually creating a Remix application

```sh {{filename:'Terminal'}}
npx create-remix@latest
```

I would also go ahead to install `tailwindcss` (personal preference). Take this as your cue to add whatever usual dependencies/components you love to build with.

### Database

In order to not make this complicated in the slightest, we would make use of [`quick.db`](https://github.com/plexidev/quick.db), a Node.js database designed for beginners in mind. In our case, that means less terminologies and more doing ðŸ™Œ.

```sh {{filename:'Terminal'}}
npm i quick.db better-sqlite3
```

In case you are wondering why we are also installing `better-sqlite3`, `quick.db` provides a driver interface that allows you to use multiple drivers including: pure JSON, Mongo and MySQL. We are using SQLite because it's the best. If you don't agree with me, you can install another driver.

<Info>
  In case you are having trouble installing, check out the troubleshooting guide on the [`quick.db` github page](https://github.com/plexidev/quick.db)
</Info>

### Service Worker

Ah, the most important part. Getting a Service Worker up and ready. Firstly, install the required `remix-pwa` packages:

```sh {{filename:'Terminal'}}
npm i @remix-pwa/sw @remix-pwa/worker-runtime
npm i -D @remix-pwa/dev
```

And we run the `remix-pwa` executable to scaffold a simple Service Worker:

```sh
npx remix-pwa sw
```

This creates a basic Service Worker in `app/entry.worker.ts`. If you want to change directories, provide the `--dest`/`-d` flag to use a separate destination file.

Finally, set up your vite config file to reflect remix pwa too, check out [this doc](/docs/main/quick-start) for more info.

## Building Noter

Before we focus on adding offline capabilities. Let's actually build the application. I would be having the following routes:

- `/`: Index route. Contains list of all todos
- `/create`: This allows you to create a new todo list (yes, you have multiple todo lists)
- `/delete`: Delete a todo
- `/$todoId`: View a todo
- `update`: Update a todo

Before we go into all that, let's handle the database. This part might need some breakdown

### Setting up the Database

`quick.db` provides a simple, yet efficient method to easily own and use a database. Let's go ahead and create a `db.server.ts` file in our app directory, we would be creating our mini-ORM in here.

Let's fill it with the following boilerplate:

```ts {{filename:'db.server.ts'}}
import { QuickDB } from 'quick.db';

const db = new QuickDB({
  filePath: `${process.cwd()}/file.db`,
})

await db.init();

export const getAllEntries = async () => {}

export const getEntry = async () => {}

export const createEntry = async () => {}

export const updateEntry = async () => {}

export const deleteEntry = async () => {}

export const deleteManyEntries = async () => {}
```

We are creating the basic outlook of the app. We can:

- Get multiple entries (note or todo checklist). Would be useful on the index route
- Get a entry
- Create an entry and persist it to our database
- Update an entry within our database
- Delete one entry
- Delete multiple entries Wat once.

We would be filling out the details soon enough. In the meantime, the application!

#### Building the Layout

This section would be an overview of what I did. First of all, I created themeing. Meaning light/dark/system modes now exist, a nice way to bump up your user comfort points. Next up, was the hardest part, building the UI ðŸ™„. My approach was something not fully styled (would have time to style later), but with a concrete layout. Thanks to [this design](https://github.com/ShafSpecs/Noter/tree/initial-app), it was easy to have an idea of what to do/expect.

Though, the design is mobile-only and my approach is mobile-first, I can modify this to fit large screens as well. Hold please...
