Remix PWA is a tool that allows you to easily integrate Progressive Web App features into your Remix project. This guide will walk you through the steps to get started with Remix PWA.

## Prerequisites

I know you're excited to get started, but before we do, let's make sure we have the following checked off:

- Remix project that utilises Remix version 2.8 or higher
- Node.js version 18 or higher (I would recommend using version 20)
- Remix is utilising **Vite**

That's right, Remix PWA v4 is just supporting Vite. So if you want to use Remix Esbuild, you would have to revert back to [v3](/docs/3.0.19)
(*or, just use Vite*)

## Installation

Installing Remix PWA is as simple as running the following commands:

```bash
npm i --save-dev @remix-pwa/dev
# this saves us some manual setup
npm i --save @remix-pwa/worker-runtime
```

Of course you would need to install some more packages to leverage the full power of PWAs but we are talking bare minimum here and that's it,
that's all you need to get started.

## Setting Up

To add Remix PWA to your app, simply add it to your `vite.config.ts` file:

```ts {{ filename: 'vite.config.ts' }}
import { remixPWA } from '@remix-pwa/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    // other plugins,
    remixPWA(),
  ],
})
```

The plugin does take in quite the options but don't worry too much about it for now. They would be explored later.

To actually have a service worker, I guess you would need to create one. You can use `remix-pwa` CLI to generate a basic one
on the spot:

```bash
npx remix-pwa sw
```

This creates an `entry.worker.ts` file in your `app` folder. Although, the service worker is quite useless and doesn't do anything
asides installing and activating itself, it is good to go ðŸ˜„.

## Why use Remix PWA?

A common question is what's the difference between Remix PWA and [Vite PWA](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/)? Simply put, Remix PWA is built
for Remix where Vite PWA isn't. Vite PWA has its perks like its agnostic nature with frameworks and its flexibility but Remix PWA is built
purposely for the ever-changing landscape of Remix. Plus, we've got a few tricks up our sleeves that you would definitely love ðŸ˜œ.

But... why use PWA at all? Good question! PWAs are the future of the web. Other than that, they provide the following benefits:

- **Improved User Experience** - PWAs offer a native-like experience, with fast load times, smooth navigation, and offline functionality.
- **Increased Engagement and Retention** - PWAs can be installed directly on the user's device, appearing like a regular app with an icon on the home screen.
- **Improved Performance** - PWAs utilize modern web technologies like Service Workers, which enable features like caching, background sync, and push notifications.
This results in faster load times, improved performance, and better resource utilization, even on low-end devices or poor network conditions.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility** - PWAs are built using standard web technologies, making them compatible across various platforms and devices,
including desktops, mobiles, and tablets.

Using Remix PWA, you can easily add PWA features to your Remix project, with little hassle and great ownership.

With that, I think we are prepared to journey out into the wilderness of documentation. Lock and load, friend! Let's move out ðŸš€
