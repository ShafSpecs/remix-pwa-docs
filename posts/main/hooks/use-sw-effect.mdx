import Info from './info.tsx'

The only hook from `@remix-pwa/sw`, the `useSWEffect` hook is used to send messages to the service worker on navigation events.

Remix PWA uses it by default to handle document caching. When a client-side navigation occurs in Remix, a fetch is made to the loader directly
from the client, but the response isn't a HTML page with embedded loader data but rather, a normal response containing data that is then embedded
into the page. Which is great for handling data caching and interception, but when you want to cache the entire page (with the loader data) to serve when offline
or as a fallback, you don't have a way to do that via the normal fetch event in the service worker.

The role of the `useSWEffect` hook in this case, is to send a message to the service worker containing the current location on every client-side navigation
(basically a `useEffect` with the `location` object as its dependency). Utilizing the `message` handler on the service worker end,
we can then fetch the entire url (simulate a document fetch), and then cache (or whatever we want) the full HTML response.

## Usage

The `useSWEffect` hook is to be used in the root of your Remix application and it grants it access to all of the navigation events
happening.

```tsx {{filename:'app/root.tsx'}}
import { useSWEffect } from '@remix-pwa/sw';

export default function App() {
  useSWEffect();
  
  // my app...
}
```

## Customising the hook

When sending messages to the Service Worker, you should be able to identify the source of the message within your Service
Worker by a constant parameter sent in all messages that can be used to differentiate them from other messages. In the case
of `useSWEffect`, the default message type when sending messages is `REMIX_NAVIGATION`.

Remix PWA then provides utilities for handling this type of message (check out the Messaging page). There are two types of caching
provided by Remix PWA: Just-In-Time (JiT) and Precaching. JiT is simply cache as I go, while Precaching is caching all the pages
in one go, at the start.

The hook takes in an object as an argument that allows you to customise the caching strategy you want to use. 

```ts
type SWMessagePayload = {
  location: Location<any>;
  isSsr: boolean;
  [key: string]: any;
}

type UseSWEffectOptions =
  | { cacheType?: 'jit' }
  | { cacheType?: 'precache' }
  | { cacheType: 'custom'; eventName: string; payload?: SWMessagePayload };
```

By default, the `cacheType` is set to `jit`. Which is intercepted by the appropriate message handler in the service worker. `precache` is
still a work-in-progress, so currently, except you handle it yourself, there's no way to precache.

Taking a closer look at the `payload`, it contains the following properties by default:

- `location`: The current location object (passed from Remix `useLocation` hook)
- `isSsr`: A boolean indicating if the current navigation is server-side rendered (document request)

It can be extended to pass more data to the service Worker.

## Extending `useSWEffect`

It's also possible that you want to send your own location-based message to the worker, `useSWEffct` is now extended to
facilitate that too. Setting the `cacheType` to `'custom'`, you can provide your own event name and a payload for passing
extra information alongside the location to the service worker.

> For more info on exactly how to handle this Service Worker-side, check out the Messaging guide.

As long as you pass in different `eventName`s, you can have multiple `useSWEffect` across your application. To further build on that,
they don't have to be in your app root, you can scope them.

Let's consider a few routes:

| Route                  | `useSWEffect` scope                                                                      |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `app/root.tsx`         | `/`. The hook would be triggered for every client-side navigation within your app        |
| `app/routes/_app.tsx`  | `/_app/$childRoute`. Any route sub-nested within the `_app` layout would trigger the hook |
| `app/routes/admin.tsx` | `/admin`. The hook would only be triggered when navigating to the admin route            |

```ts
import { useSWEffect } from '@remix-pwa/sw';

export default function LayoutRoute() {
  useSWEffect({
    cacheType: 'custom',
    eventName: 'MY_CUSTOM_EVENT',
    payload: {
      loveMom: true // ðŸ¥°
    } 
  });
  
  // my route...
}
```
<Info>
The custom payload passed to the hook is always merged with the default payload properties (`location` & `isSsr`) except when overriden.

Using the example above, the resulting payload would look like this:

```ts
{
  location: Location<any>,
  isSsr: boolean,
  loveMom: true
}
```
</Info>
