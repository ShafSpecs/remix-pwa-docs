The `usePWAManager` hook is a utility hook exported from `@remix-pwa/client` that allows you to manage and access your PWA application
main states like service worker registration and installation. The hook takes no argument and returns an object.

{/* > This hook is done and a work-in-proress,  */}
It has a type definition as follows:

```ts
type UpdateAvailable = {
  isUpdateAvailable: boolean;
  newWorker: ServiceWorker | null;
};

usePWAManager: () => {
  updateAvailable: boolean;
  swUpdate: UpdateAvailable;
  promptInstall: () => void;
  swRegistration: ServiceWorkerRegistration | null;
  userInstallChoice: "accepted" | "dismissed" | null;
}
```

## `updateAvailable`

This is a boolean value that indicates if there is an update available for the PWA application. It is `true` if there is an
update available to the service worker and `false` otherwise.

A good use case for this would be to implement a "prompt" to the user to reload the page when an update is available.

## `swUpdate`

This is an object that contains information about the update available, think of it as a more verbose `updateAvailable` property. It has the following properties:

- `isUpdateAvailable`: A boolean value that indicates if there is an update available for the PWA application. This carries the same value as `updateAvailable`.
- `newWorker`: A `ServiceWorker` object that represents the new service worker that is available for the PWA application (hasn't been activated yet). It is `null` if there is no update available.

## `promptInstall`

This is a method that allows you to customise the installation prompt for your PWA application. It is a function that you **must**
call via a user interaction (click, hover, etc.) to trigger the installation prompt.

Currently, you can't customise the prompt. I am working on making that possible in the not-so-distant future.

## `swRegistration`

This is a `ServiceWorkerRegistration` object that represents the service worker registration for the PWA application. It is `null`
if there is no service worker registered. Can be used to access the service worker registration object which opens up a lot of
possibilities to build upon like sync, periodic sync and push notifications.

## `userInstallChoice`

This is a string value that represents the user's choice when prompted to install the PWA application. It can be one of the
following values:

- `accepted`: The user accepted the installation prompt.
- `dismissed`: The user dismissed the installation prompt.
- `null`: The user has not been prompted to install the PWA application.

This can be used to track the user's choice and provide feedback to the user.

This hook is complete and also a work-in-progress, I am exploring ways to expand the capabilities of the hook to make it more
useful and powerful (your PWA swiss knife). If you have any suggestions or ideas, feel free to discuss them in Remix PWA
[Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/remix-pwa/discussions).
