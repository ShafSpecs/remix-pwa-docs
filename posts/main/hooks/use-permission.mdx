import Info from './info.tsx'

The `usePermission` hook is a new utility hook that allows you to check various permissions on the client.

It takes in a single argument, the permission you want to check. The permission can be any of the following:

- `geolocation`
- `notifications`
- `persistent-storage`
- `push`
- `screen-wake-lock`
- `xr-spatial-tracking`

Note that these are the official, universal ones. Some browsers might have additional permissions that aren't listed here (like Chrome and `camera` and Safari with `microphone`).

It returns an object of just one property:

- `permissionStatus`: An object with the just one property:
  - `state`: The state of the permission. This can be one of the following:
    - `granted`: The permission is granted.
    - `denied`: The permission is denied.
    - `prompt`: The permission is yet to be granted or denied.

This hook currently doesn't provide a way to request permissions exclusively due to the API still being in very early beta - once it's stable, we'd add that feature.

<Info>
  For Push API enthusiasts, when checking permission for push, put in mind that the `notifications` and `push` permissions have been merged and it's better to check for `notifications` anyways, as it's more universal and access to the notification permission automatically means access to the push permission.

## Type Signature

The `usePermission` hook has the following type signature:

```ts
type PermissionName =
  | 'geolocation'
  | 'notifications'
  | 'persistent-storage'
  | 'push'
  | 'screen-wake-lock'
  | 'xr-spatial-tracking';

type PermissionState = 'granted' | 'denied' | 'prompt';

interface PermissionStatus {
  state: PermissionState;
}

usePermission(permission: PermissionName): { PermissionStatus };
```
