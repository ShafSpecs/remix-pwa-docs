import Info from './info.tsx'

The `usePush` hook is built on the browser's Push API to provide the necessary utilities for handling push notifications in your PWA client.
Present in the `@remix-pwa/push` package, the hook has the following type signature:

```ts
usePush: () => {
  isSubscribed: boolean;
  pushSubscription: PushSubscription | null;
  requestPermission: () => NotificationPermission;
  subscribeToPush: (
    publicKey: string,
    callback?: (subscription: PushSubscription) => void,
    errorCallback?: (error: any) => void
  ) => void;
  unsubscribeFromPush: (callback?: () => void, errorCallback?: (error: any) => void) => void;
  canSendPush: boolean;
}
```

<Info>
The hook can be imported via `@remix-pwa/push` or `@remix-pwa/push/hook` (for better tree-shaking)
</Info>

## `isSubscribed`

The `isSubscribed` property is a boolean to indicate wether the user is subscribed to push notifications or not.

## `pushSubscription`

The `pushSubscription` property is a `PushSubscription` object that holds the subscription details of the user. It could be `null` if
the user isn't subscribed to push notifications.

## `canSendPush`

The `canSendPush` property is a boolean to indicate if the browser supports push notifications, and wether the user has allowed for notifications to be sent.

The difference between this and `isSubscribed` is that `isSubscribed` only checks if the user is subscribed to push notifications, while `canSendPush` checks if you are even allowed to send notifications in the first place.

## `requestPermission`

The `requestPermission` function is used to request permission from the user to send push notifications. It returns a `NotificationPermission` string value. Could be one of the following:

- `granted`: The user has explicitly granted permission for the current origin to display system notifications.
- `denied`: The user has explicitly denied permission for the current origin to display system notifications.
- `default`: The user decision is unknown; in this case the application will act as if permission was denied.

Works in tandem with `canSendPush`, the values would be updated as the user interacts with the PWA.

## `subscribeToPush`

The `subscribeToPush` function is used to subscribe the user to push notifications. It takes in the `publicKey` of the VAPID key pair, and an optional `callback` and `errorCallback` function.

The callback passed in here is invoked when the user is successfully subscribed to push notifications, and the `errorCallback` is called when there's an error subscribing the user. You can use it to perform further checks, logging, updates or ping the server.

```tsx
import { usePush } from '@remix-pwa/push'

// in the component

const { subscribeToPush } = usePush()

const publicKey = 'your-public-key'

subscribeToPush(publicKey, (subscription) => {
  logger.log('User subscribed to push notifications!', subscription)
  fetch('/api/subscribe', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(subscription)
  })
}, (error) => {
  logger.error('Error subscribing user to push notifications!', error)
})
```

## `unsubscribeFromPush`

The `unsubscribeFromPush` function is used to unsubscribe the user from push notifications. It takes in an optional `callback` and `errorCallback` function.

The callback is invoked when the user is successfully unsubscribed from push notifications, and the `errorCallback` is called when there's an error unsubscribing the user.

```ts
import { usePush } from '@remix-pwa/push'

// in the component

const { unsubscribeFromPush } = usePush()

unsubscribeFromPush(() => {
  logger.log('User unsubscribed from push notifications!')
  fetch('/api/unsubscribe', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ subscription: pushSubscription })
  })
}, (error) => {
  logger.error('Error unsubscribing user from push notifications!', error)
})
```

The `usePush` (client) hook is just one side of the coin. The flipside, server, is a more sophisticated topic covered, alongside others, in the [Push API doc](/docs/main/push-api)
