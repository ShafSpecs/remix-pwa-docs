The `ManifestLink` component from `@remix-pwa/sw` is a utility component to help with registering a manifest file. Saves having
to write the whole link tag yourself.

Utilise it just above Remix's `<Links />` component within your app's root.

It takes one prop: `manifestUrl` which is the URL to your manifest file. By default, this is `/manifest.webmanifest`.

```tsx
import { ManifestLink } from '@remix-pwa/sw';

export default function App() {
  return (
    // Add the ManifestLink component just above Remix's Links component
    <ManifestLink manifestUrl="/manifest.json" /> // can leave blank for default
    <Links />
    // Your app's content
  );
}
```
