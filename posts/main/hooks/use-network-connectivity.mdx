The `useNetworkConnectivity` hook is a simple utility hook for interacting with device network connectivity status.

It is a simple hook that returns a boolean value indicating whether the device is connected to the internet or not. It has the
following signature:

```typescript
useNetworkConnectivity = (options?: {
  onOnline?: (isOnline: boolean) => void;
  onOffline?: (isOnline: boolean) => void;
}) => boolean;
```

It takes in an optional `options` object with the following properties:

- `onOnline`: A callback function that is called when the device goes online.
- `onOffline`: A callback function that is called when the device goes offline.

```tsx
import { useNetworkConnectivity } from '@remix-pwa/client';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const isOnline = useNetworkConnectivity({
    onOnline: (isOnline) => {
      console.log('Device is online');
    },
    onOffline: (isOnline) => {
      console.log('Device is offline');
    },
  });

  return <div>{isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline'}</div>;
};
```
