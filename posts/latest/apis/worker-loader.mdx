The counterpart to `workerAction`, `workerLoader` work very much the same way. The difference being the kind of requests they intercept.

> Don't forget, you must return a response from your route worker APIs!

## `request`

Like `workerAction`, `workerLoader` also accespts the same arguments. Including the `request` object which is the incoming request object.

## `context`

The `context` object is the same as well. It holds the global state of the worker thread.

## `params`

The [`params`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/loader#params) is the route object containing dynamic parameters defined by the route.

## Gotchas

`workerLoader` intercepts requests made to the loader within your app with one caveat: they don't run during the first load (document request). By default, they run on client-side navigation. This behaviour can be changed by revalidating within your
`root` file:

```ts {{filename:'app/root.tsx'}}
export default function App () {
  const revalidator = useRevalidator();

  useEffect(() => {
    revalidator.revalidate();
  }, []);

  // rest of your app component...
}
```

This ensures that the worker loader runs on the first load as well.

> What about if you don't want to revalidate and at the same time want to run it on first load? No idea. I am working
> on improving this behaviour especially and haven't found a reliable way to do this yet.
