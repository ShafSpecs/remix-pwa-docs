`logger` is a `Console` wrapper for Remix PWA that provides much better looking logs in the console.

It can be utilized like a normal logger:

```ts
import { logger } from '@remix-pwa/sw';

logger.log('Hello, world!');
```

Or can be customised to provide better ownership

## `Logger`

The `Logger` class is a class that allows you to create your own logger, with your own styles, prefix and more.

### Instantiating `Logger`

To create a new `Logger` instance, you can easily do so via the `Logger` constructor:

```ts
import { Logger } from '@remix-pwa/sw';

const logger = new Logger();
```

When no options are provided, the logger will use the default options.

#### Constructor Options

The `Logger` constructor accepts the following options:

- `prefix` - The prefix to be used in the logs. By default, this is `remix-pwa`.
- `logLevel` - The log level to be used. By default, this is `info`. Check out the [Log Levels](#log-levels) section for more information.
- `styles` - The styles to be used in the logs. By default, this is a pre-defined set of styles for each log level, you
can choose to extend or override these styles, individually or collectively.
- `isProductionEnv` - This would be auto-filled in by Remix PWA Vite bundler. **Don't** set this manually.

### `Logger` methods

The `Logger` class provides the following methods:

- `debug` - Logs a message with the `debug` log level.
- `info` - Logs a message with the `info` log level.
- `log` - Logs a message with the `log` log level.
- `warn` - Logs a message with the `warn` log level.
- `error` - Logs a message with the `error` log level.
- `groupCollapsed` - Logs a group of messages with the `log` log level.
- `groupEnd` - Ends a group of messages.

They perform the same as the `console` methods, but with better looking logs.

The other set fo not-so-conventional methods include:

- `setLogLevel` - Sets the log level for the logger.
- `setStyles` - Sets the styles for the logger. Can be used to override styles after instantiation.

## Log Levels

Log levels in Remix PWA `Logger` is a hierarchical structure, that allows you to filter out logs based on their severity.

The log levels are as follows:

- `debug` - The most verbose log level. Used for debugging purposes.
- `info` - The default log level. Used for general information.
- `log` - The default log level. Used for general information.
- `warn` - The warning log level. Used for non-critical issues.
- `error` - The error log level. Used for critical issues.

The log levels are hierarchical, meaning that a log level will log all logs of its level and below.

## `logger`

The `logger` export is a pre-instantiated `Logger` instance with the default options.
