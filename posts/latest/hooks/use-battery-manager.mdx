This hook is one of those utility hook that wouldn't see much use, buf if you need 'em, you gottem. The hook
allows you to interact with the battery manager and access the device battery level and charging state.

> Be sure to check its compatibility with your target browsers before using it.

The hook has the following signature:

```typescript
useBatteryManager = (options?: {
  onChargingChange?: (isCharging: boolean) => void;
  onLevelChange?: (batteryLevel: number) => void;
}) => {
  batteryLevel: number;
  isCharging: boolean;
};
```

The `options` parameter is an object that can have two optional properties:

- `onChargingChange`: A callback function that is called whenever the charging state changes.
- `onLevelChange`: A callback function that is called whenever the battery level changes.

It returns an object with two properties:

- `batteryLevel`: The current battery level as a number between 0 and 1.
- `isCharging`: A boolean indicating whether the device is currently charging.

Here's an example of how you can use the `useBatteryManager` hook:

```tsx
import { useBatteryManager } from '@remix-pwa/client';

function BatteryStatus() {
  const { batteryLevel, isCharging } = useBatteryManager({
    onChargingChange: (isCharging) => {
      console.log('Charging state changed:', isCharging);
    },
    onLevelChange: (batteryLevel) => {
      console.log('Battery level changed:', batteryLevel);
    },
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Battery Level: {batteryLevel}</p>
      <p>Charging: {isCharging ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

If you are building a PWA that interacts with the battery in some way, you've got the right tool for the job ðŸ˜‰.
