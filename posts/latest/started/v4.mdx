As the [Quick Start](/docs/latest/quick-start) docs might have informed you, Remix PWA v4 utilises just Vite. Previously,
Remix PWA utilised `esbuild` and was built to work in tandem with the Remix esbuild framework. As such, we needed to keep
supporting Remix Esbuild going forward.

Remix has made the decision to leave behind their esbuild compiler and move to Vite fully. This literally meant we had no
reason to keep supporting esbuild. As such, we have made the decision to move to Vite fully as well. In other words, we have yeeted
esbuild out of the window.

## Upgrading from v3 to v4

To ugrade from v3 to v4, you will first need to make sure your Remix application is a Vite one. That means no `remix.config.js` and
a `@remix-run/*` version of at least `^2.8.1`. If you don't know how to do so, check out the [Remix documentation](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/future/vite#migrating) on how to do so and
also [this](https://alemtuzlak.hashnode.dev/migrating-a-v1-cjs-remix-project-to-remix-vite-esm) great article by my friend, [Alem Tuzlak](https://github.com/AlemTuzlak) on converting
Remix CJS apps to Vite ESM.

Once you have done that, upgrade your `@remix-pwa/*` packages to the latest version (the version numbers aren't uniform, so just use the `latest` tag
when installing). A few packages have also been deprecated: `@remix-pwa/cache` has been sunsetted (ðŸš®) and also `@remix-pwa/strategy`. You can go ahead
and remove both of them from your `package.json`, if present.

Add the `remixPWA()` plugin to your newly created `vite.config.ts` file, Remix PWA now handles registration automatically (except you opt out), so you
can also go ahead and delete the `loadServiceWorker` function present in the entry client file.

Within your service worker, you also want to reduce your Service Worker down to just the `install` and `activate` handler. We would still be
building it back up but a lot of breaking API changes have been made to the other APIs and would need to be re-implemented.

Remix Vite (and Remix PWA) now handle HMR (Hot Module Reloading) internally, so if you are utilsing the `LiveReload` component, you can go ahead and remove it.

That's about it. Upgrading from v3 to v4 isn't as hard as it seems. If you have any issues, feel free to open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/remix-pwa/monorepo)

## Upgrading from older versions to v4

Firstly, allow me to ask: What happened? Why?

Next, upgrading would be very similar too upgrading from v3. The most important thing in there is having a **Remix Vite** application.
Once that's been covered, you can go ahead and follow the steps above.
