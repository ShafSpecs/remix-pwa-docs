## Introduction

### Synopsis

Caching in the browser has been a thing that's existed for a long time. A simple key-value store (cache) for storing responses with requests as keys and it was packaged in
the `Cache` API. We also have the `CacheStorage` API that allows us to create and manage multiple caches. That was all that
caching responses in the browser involved, until now.

`RemixCache` is a wrapper around the `Cache` API that allows us to store and retrieve responses from the cache with more refined control.
It supercharges the `Cache` API by adding some additional features to the normal caching process of storing and retrieving responses.

By default, items live in the cache forever with no limit, you are also allowed to store as much as you like which is fine,
till you want to finetune your cache. `RemixCache` is a framework-agnostic wrapper (it works outside Remix too!) that utilises the browser cache with expiration, and size limits.
That's not all, it also allows integration with `cachified`, a popular library for caching, shipping with all these right out the box!

### Installation

To get started, run:

```bash
npm install `@remix-pwa/cache`
```

`RemixCache` isn't directly available to be able to create and mutate, but no worries, cause `@remix-pwa/cache` also ships with a `RemixCacheStorage` which is available
in the global scope (worker & main thread). `RemixCacheStorage` (alias `Storage`) is a wrapper around the `CacheStorage` API that allows us to create and
manage multiple caches of `RemixCache` instances.

### Basic Usage

Using `@remix-pwa/cache` is no different to using the `Cache` API. The only difference is to make sure you have opened the cache somewhere at the top of your service worker
before utilising it anywhere else to ensure it is always wrapped. It's no different from how it used to be in Remix PWA v2.x.x.

<Snippet>

```ts {{ filename:'entry.worker.ts' }}
import { Storage } from "@remix-pwa/cache";

// Here we open a cache called 'my-cache'
// `cache` is an instance of `RemixCache`
const cache = await Storage.open("my-cache", {
  // ...options for the cache
});

// somewhere in the abyss of my service worker...

cache.put("https://example.com", new Response("Hello World!"));
```

```ts {{ filename:'app/routes/dashboard.tsx' }}
import { Storage } from '@remix-pwa/cache'

// somewhere in my `workerLoader` function...
try {
  const cache = await Storage.open('my-cache');
  const response = await fetchFromServer();
  cache.put(contextRequest, response, 86_400_000); // cache for 1 day
} catch (err) {
  queueToServer({
    name: 'generalSync',
    request: //...
  })
}
```

</Snippet>

### Some Advanced Stuffs

How does `RemixCache` work? Can I use it with the normal browser `CacheStorage` API?

Answering the last question first, yes you can! `RemixCache` is a wrapper around the `Cache` API, so it's just a normal cache.

First question is a bit more tricky. A little backstory might help with the understanding of how `RemixCache` works.

<Details title={'A little backstory on how the cache package came about'}>

I got the idea for `RemixCache` from [`cachified`](https://github.com/Xiphe/cachified), after trying to
unsuccessfully bring more flexibity to the `Cache` API in Remix PWA v2, I decided to re-attempt it in Remix PWA v3. Looking at a few caching solutions,
and testing them out with the new APIs you are looking at before you, I stumbled upon `cachified`.

`cachified` is a library for caching with your favourite caching solution, it allows you to cache via memory and Redis out-of-the-box. Plus, it's extensibility
means you can create adapters for it to cache with any other solution you want. I tested it out by creating an adapter for the `Cache` API and it worked like a charm.

Next up was figuring how to replicate it. After a bit of inspection, I realised that `cachified` actively modified the response (value) before storing
it. It was genius! You had your response which looked like this:

```ts
const response = new Response(value, {
  headers,
  status,
  statusText
});
```

now wrapped into something like this:

```ts
const response = new Response(
  JSON.stringify({
    value,
    metadata: {
      /* Metadata. Where magic occured */
    }
  }),
  {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      headers
    },
    status,
    statusText
  }
);
```

I fell in love with the implementation. It was simple, fast enough and it worked. So I decided to go along with it.

</Details>

I hope you read the backstory, if you didn't, you should. It's important to understanding how `RemixCache` works. Now, let's get to the main question.

Looking at the backstory, you would see the new schematics that `Response` were now wrapped with. It is all about the metadata. `RemixCache` works by
simply comparing, deleting, adding, sorting based on the metadata. That way, you can introduce expiration, size limits and more to your cache.

Can you interface with it directly? Sure thing! `RemixCache` is just a normal cache, so you can use it with the `CacheStorage` API. To use it, you simply
need to remember that all caches of `RemixCache` instance are prefixed by `rp-` and the name of the cache. So if you have a cache called `my-cache`, you can
access it via `caches.open('rp-my-cache')`. You can also use `Storage.open('my-cache')` to open it.

Looking at the model in the backstory above, I suppose I can leave you to your whims, fancies and imagination on what to do now that you have
a clearer picture of how `RemixCache` works. I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed creating it for you ❤️.

## API Reference

### `RemixCache`

`RemixCache` is the star of this package. The wrapper around the `Cache` API that allows us to store and retrieve responses from the cache with more refined control.

Currently, instantiation of `RemixCache` directly is impossible. And it was a purposeful decision, you can only nteract with via the [`Storage`](/docs/remix-cache#remix-cache-storage)
API. This is to ensure that all caches are wrapped and you don't have to worry about it getting inconsistent later on.

First of all, `RemixCache` implements the following interface:

```ts
interface CustomCache extends Omit<Cache, "addAll" | "matchAll"> {
  put(request: RequestInfo | URL, response: Response, ttl?: number | undefined): Promise<void>;
}
```

It re-implements the `put` method of the `Cache` API to allow for expiration of items in the cache. It also adds a `ttl` parameter to the method to allow you
specify the time to live of that particular item in the cache. If you don't specify a `ttl`, the item will utilise the general ttl of the cache.

The other methods work the same way and accept the same arguments like the `Cache` API. Check out the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache) for more info.

A look at the constructor of `RemixCache`:

```ts
enum Strategy {
  CacheFirst = 'cache-first',
  NetworkFirst = 'network-first',
  CacheOnly = 'cache-only',
  NetworkOnly = 'network-only',
  StaleWhileRevalidate = 'stale-while-revalidate',
}

constructor({
    name: string;
    strategy?: Strategy;
    maxItems?: number;
    ttl?: number;
}: RemixCacheOptions) {}
```

<Info>
  Whilst runtime caching strategies in Remix PWA are handled via the `@remix-pwa/strategies` package, the strategy
  passed in here is useful (quite useful actually) when utilising it with tools like `cachified` (which is supported out
  of the box!).
</Info>

The constructor accepts an object with the following properties:

- `name`: The name of the cache. This is used to identify the cache in the `CacheStorage` API.
- `strategy`: The caching strategy to use. This is useful when utilising `RemixCache` with `cachified`. Defaults to `Strategy.NetworkFirst`.
- `maxItems`: The maximum number of items to store in the cache. Defaults to `100`.
- `ttl`: The default time to live of items in the cache. Defaults to `Infinity`.

If you have any further questions or feel this section can be improved, please feel free to open an issue or PR.

### `RemixCacheStorage`

`RemixCacheStorage` is a static class that allows us to create and manage multiple caches of `RemixCache` instances. A good question you might be having
now is why not a wrapper around `CacheStorage` API. Good question, I have no idea myself. Wrapping it would mean making it a non-static class though,
and require you to instantiate it and pass it to the route workers via the `getLoadContext` function (plus, it might be restricted to just the worker thread).
If you think that's a better idea, I would be happy to hear your thoughts on it (RFCs are welcome!).

As mentioned earlier, `RemixCacheStorage` is alias to `Storage`. You can use either of them, they are the same thing.

`RemixCacheStorage` implements the following interface:

```ts
interface CustomCacheStorage {
  createCache(opts: RemixCacheOptions): Promise<RemixCache>;
  has(name: string): Promise<boolean>;
  get(name: string): RemixCache | undefined;
  open(name: string, opts?: Omit<RemixCacheOptions, 'name'>): RemixCache
  delete(name: string);
  clear();
}
```

And a few more that if you ask me, best to stay away from them.

The methods are pretty self-explanatory, but I would explain them anyway.

- `createCache`: Creates a new cache with the specified options. Returns a promise that resolves to the created cache.
- `has`: Checks if a cache with the specified name exists. Returns a promise that resolves to a boolean.
- `get`: Gets a cache with the specified name. Returns the cache if it exists, else `undefined`.
- `open`: Opens a cache with the specified name. Returns the cache if it exists, else creates a new cache with the specified options and returns it.
- `delete`: Deletes a cache with the specified name.
- `clear`: Clears all caches.

Also a few things to note:

- `open` is preferred over `createCache` as it is more performant. Use whenever you can.
- `@remix-pwa/cache` also ships with two functions: `initCache` and `createCache`. Both are aliases to each other and are
short hand for `Storage.createCache`.

### `cachified`

We haven't forgptten `cachified`, in fact, we shipped an adapter just for it! `@remix-pwa/cache` ships with an [adapter](/docs/remix-cache#remix-cache-adapter) 
for `cachified` that allows you to utilise the `Cache` API (utilizing `RemixCache` ofc). It also ships with a wrapper around `cachified` itself 
that provides you a short-hand to use it. It has the following interface:

```ts
export type CachifiedWrapperOptions = {
  key: string;
  cache: RemixCache;
  getFreshValue: GetFreshValue<any>;
  swr?: number;
  ttl?: number;
  staleRefreshTimeout?: number;
  reporter?: CreateReporter<any>;
};

const cachifiedWrapper = (opts: CachifiedWrapperOptions) => {};
```

The `cachifiedWrapper` function accepts an object with properties similar to the `cachified` options. Check them 
out [here](https://github.com/Xiphe/cachified#options).

The key thing to note is that the `strategy` parameter (of `RemixCache`) is important here. For example, if you utilise a
`NetworkOnly` strategy, you would not be able to cache anything because the `ttl` would always be -1 (meaning, don't cache).

Also, if you utilise any strategy other than `StaleWhileRevalidate`, `swr` would not be applicable.

### `remixCacheAdapter`

The `remixCacheAdapter` is useful when you want more control over `cachified` and want to use it with `cachified` directly.

It is used to wrap `RemixCache` into something `cachified` can interface with and take in one parameter: `cache` which is the `RemixCache` instance.

```ts
import { remixCacheAdapter } from '@remix-pwa/cache'

const remixCache = await Storage.open('my-cache');

const cache = remixCacheAdapter(caremixCacheche);

await cachified({
  cache,
  key: request.url,
  getFreshValue() {
    return fetch(request);
  },
});
```
