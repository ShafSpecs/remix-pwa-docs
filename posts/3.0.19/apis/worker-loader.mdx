import Info from './info.tsx'
import Warn from './warn.tsx'

Each route can define a `workerLoader` that intercepts requests to the `loader`.

```tsx
import { json } from "@remix-run/node"; // or cloudflare/deno
import { json as client } from "@remix-pwa/sw";

export const loader = async () => {
  return json({ message: "server" });
};

export const workerLoader = async (request) => {
  return client({ message: "worker loader"});
};

export default function Index() {
  return <h1>Index</h1>;
}
```

## `request`

This is a [Fetch Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) instance. Read up the MDN docs to learn more about it.

The most common use case for this is actually fetching the request, reading cookies, getting URLs or caching a particular route:

```ts
export const workerLoader = async ({ request }) => {
  // get the request method
  const method = request.method;

  // read a cookie
  const cookie = request.headers.get("Cookie");

  // parse the search params for `?q=`
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  const query = url.searchParams.get("q");
};
```

<Warn>
Remix PWA strips down the `request` object and removes the `_data` property (like Remix)

If you want to access the original request, you can use `context.event.request` instead.
</Warn>

## `params`

Route params are defined by route file names. If a segment begins with `$` like `$invoiceId`, the value from the URL for that segment will be passed to your fetch handler (just like Remix!).

```ts {{ filename: 'app/routes/$invoiceId' }}
import type { WorkerLoaderArgs } from "@remix-pwa/sw";

export const workerLoader = async ({ request, params }: WorkerLoaderArgs) => {
  // if the user visits /invoices/123
  // params.invoiceId will be "123"
  const invoiceId = params.invoiceId;
};
```

## `context`

This is the context passed into your fetch handlers via Remix PWA's [`getLoadContext`](/docs/get-load-context) function. This is a very powerful tool that allows you to pass data
around the worker thread. A simple `getLoadContext` example:

```ts {{ filename: 'entry.worker.ts' }}
import type { GetLoadContextFunction } from "@remix-pwa/sw";

export const getLoadContext: GetLoadContextFunction = async (event: fetchEvent) => {
  const { request } = event;
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  const query = url.searchParams.get("filter");

  return { filterQuery: query };
};
```

And you can utilise this in your loader:

```ts {{ filename: 'app/routes/text.tsx' }}
export const workerLoader = async ({ request, context }) => {
  const { filterQuery } = context;

  // do something with filterQuery
};
```

<Info>
Remix PWA models its Route APIs after Remix's own. So `context`, `params` and `request` are no much different from how you approach
them in `action`s or `loader`s.
</Info>

## Returning Responses from `workerLoader`

You must return a `Response` object from your `workerLoader` function. `workerLoader` functions behave like Remix's loaders and actions 
in the sense that whenever it is defined, it must return something. 

You can use Remix PWA's `json` helper to return JSON responses:

```ts
import { json } from "@remix-pwa/pwa";

// ...

export const workerLoader = async ({ request }) => {
  return json({ message: "worker loader found"});
};
```

## Throwing Errors from `workerLoader`

You can throw errors from your `workerLoader` function. Remember, the client now views `workerLoader` as the new `loader` (server), so you can throw
errors from it to help with redirecting or triggering `ErrorBoundary`:

```ts {{ filename: 'app/routes/$invoiceId' }}
import { redirect } from "@remix-pwa/sw";

export const workerLoader = async ({ request, params }) => {
  const invoiceId = params.invoiceId;

  if (!invoiceId) {
    throw redirect("/invoices");
  }

  // ...

  return null // never forget to return something
};
```
