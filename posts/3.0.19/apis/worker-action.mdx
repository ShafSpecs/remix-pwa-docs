You've heard of Remix [`action`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/action), you know what it does. In case you don't, here is a quick rundown:

> *`action`s are server-only functions that handle data mutations and other actions. If a non-GET request is made to your 
> route (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) then the action is called before the loaders.*

Cool, the keyword there is **server-only**. `workerAction` is exactly the same (maybe a bit more outrageous) but it runs on only the worker thread instead.

## workerAction

### The Basics

Previously, all requests made in Remix PWA where routed to your main service worker file and handled from there. This is no longer the case thanks to the
Remix PWA [compiler](/docs/technical-explanation#compiler). Utilising the same approach as Remix did, we can now route requests to a worker file and handle them there.

Whenever a non-GET request is made in a route with an `action`, the `workerAction` intercepts it and handles it in the worker thread (service worker is a middle-layer, remember?). 
This means that you can now handle your data mutations and other actions in the worker thread, leaving your main thread free to do other things. The Remix `action` isn't obsolete though
as you still require a server to process requests and send responses. The `workerAction` is just a way to offload some of the work to the worker thread as well as keep your code clean.

Talk about perfomance :rocket:!

### Usage

The `workerAction` is used in the same way as the `action` is used. 

```tsx
export const action = () => {
  /* ... */
}

export const workerAction = ({ context, request }) => {
  /* Handle your stuffs here like a champ! */
}
```

You can explore the arguments passed in detail in the [`defaultFetchHandler`](/docs/default-fetch-handler#api) page.

<Warn>
Avoid utilising `workerAction` in a route without an `action` as it <u>could</u> lead to unpredictable behaviour.

This would be a problem if you forward requests to the server in your `workerAction` as it. But you can fetch external resources just fine in here,
just note that this is the client you are running on. Don't expect to be able to access server-side resources or make the mistake of exposing secrets in here.
</Warn> 

```tsx
export const workerAction = ({ context, request }) => {
  /* Handling stuffs with no action */
}
```

### `workerAction` vs `action`

The `workerAction` differ from `action` based on where they run and what they can do. The `workerAction` runs on the worker thread and can only do things that the worker thread can do (can't run server-side content, for example)
while the `action` runs on the server and can only do things that the server can do (can't run client-side content, for example).

Asides from that, they are pretty much the same. They both have access to the `context` (which are two different objects), `params` and `request` objects.

## The Deep Dive 🤿

### `WorkerActionArgs`

The `workerAction` function is passed an object with the following properties:

```tsx
interface WorkerActionArgs {
  context: WorkerContext
  request: Request
  params: string
}
```

- `context` - The worker `context` object created by the [`getLoadContext`](/docs/get-load-context) function. It defaults to a simple object containing
the `FetchEvent` object and a `fetchFromServer` function to forward requests to the server. You can add your own properties to this object by passing them to the `getLoadContext` function.
- `request` - The request object of the request being handled. Note, like Remix, the `request` object is stripped of it's `_data` property. If you want the full request (including `_data`), you can access it via the `context` object.
- `params` - The params of the route being handled. Exactly the same as the `params` passed to the `action` function.

### How does it work?

I've read the [technical explanation](/docs/technical-explanantion) and I still don't get how this works. It is very interesting yet difficult to grasp 🤯.

No problem (or as we say here, [no wahala](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=no+wahala) 😜), let me break it into small steps we can follow along:

- First of all, you run `remix-pwa dev`. This starts up the compiler and starts a chain of events.
- First, configs are loaded in from your `remix.config.js` file. The compiler then starts to compile your routes.
- It goes through your entire application doing some magic stuffs ✨.
- Part of that magic is emptying your entire routes of the component, loader, actions and whatever else you have in there. Except the `workerAction` and `workerLoader`.
- It then builds a manifest of it's own using that information (Btw, this manifest is available in your service worker via `self.__workerManifest`).
- It then builds all necessary information from your routes with your service worker into one massive service worker in the `public` folder.
- When a fetch event happens, the service worker runtime intercepts it and then handles it. Using the manifest data as well as a few other information available to it,
it checks wether that route has a `workerAction` (in the case of a non-`GET` request).
- If it does have, it then leaves it in the hand of the `workerAction` to handle it. If it doesn't have, it then forwards the request to
the `defaultFetchHandler` exported from your service worker, if it is not available, it just runs `fetch(request)`.

That's it! That's how it works. I hope that was easy to follow along. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the [Discord](https://rmx.as/discord) or [Github](https://github.com/remix-pwa/monorepo).

## Tips

### Keep things simple

This is a constant advice throughout your usage of Remix PWA. The power is in your hands to do whatever you want, but you should always keep things simple.

As you might have realised, you can transform `workerAction` into a server of sorts. You can also choose to manipulate requests and responses as much as you like
with no constraints. But always try to keep it simple, when it's time to go complex (and you would know), then do so proudly. Asides from that, keep it simple :+1:.
