## getLoadContext

### Basic Usage

The `getLoadContext` function is used to create a global `context` object for the worker thread. You can utilize this to share data between your routes and your worker thread
as well as common utilities, stores, etc.

<Snippet>

```ts {{ filename:'entry.worker.ts' }}
export const getLoadContext = () => {
  return {
    foo: "bar",
    key: "value"
  };
};
```

```tsx {{ filename:'app/routes/docs.tsx' }}
export const workerLoader = async ({ context, request }) => {
  const { foo, key } = context;

  return new Response(`foo: ${foo}, key: ${key}`); // foo: bar, key: value
};
```

</Snippet>

This is a basic example showcasing how you can use the `context` object to share data between your routes and your worker thread.
Let's try something a bit more complex.

### Advanced Usage

<Snippet>

```ts {{ filename:'entry.worker.ts' }}
import type { GetLoadContextFunction } from "@remix-pwa/sw";

export const getLoadContext: GetLoadContextFunction = () => {
  // a fake function supposed to return a store of strings
  const store = createStoreRepo<string>();

  return {
    foo: "bar",
    key: "value",
    store,
    utils: {
      get: () => store.get(),
      set: (value: string) => store.set(value),
      del: (value: string) => store.del(value)
    }
  };
};
```

```tsx {{ filename:'app/routes/form.tsx' }}
import type { WorkerActionArgs } from "@remix-pwa/sw";

export const action = async ({ request }) => {
  const form = await request.formData();
  const type = form.get("type");

  if (!type || type.length < 2) {
    return new Response("BAD_RESPONSE");
  }

  return new Response("ok");
};

export const workerAction = async ({ context }: WorkerActionArgs) => {
  const { utils, fetchFromServer } = context;

  try {
    // This fetches from the route's action
    const response = await fetchFromServer();

    const text = await response.text();

    if (text === "BAD_RESPONSE") {
      return new Response("Bad Response", {
        status: 400
      });
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);

    throw new Response("Internal Server Error", {
      status: 500
    });
  }

  const formData = await request.formData();
  const type = formData.get("type");
  const value = formData.get("value");

  switch (type) {
    case "get":
      return new Response(utils.get());
    case "set":
      utils.set(value);
      return new Response("ok");
    case "del":
      utils.del(value);
      return new Response("ok");
    default:
      return new Response("invalid action");
  }
};
```

</Snippet>

A bit more complex but still the same idea. We are creating a store and exposing it to the worker thread via the `context` object.
Then consuming it in our route to create a simple form that can get, set, and delete values from the store whenever a submission is made.

### Scenario

Let me whip up a real-life scenario based on the last example to help you further understand what can be accomplished `context` object.

Imagine we have a settings form on a settings page, we typically don't want to fetch settings from the database all the time so we decide
to store it in the browser's indexedDB. The store **must** be synced with the database so we don't have issue with stale data. What we decided to do is
introduce [`workerAction`]('/docs/worker-action'), a route action that is executed in the worker thread. This intercepts requests to Remix `action` in the route
and allows us to do whatever we want with it. In this case, we want to sync the store with the database.

We do this by calling `fetchFromServer` which is simply a function that passes the request onto the server (`fetch(request.clone())` under the hood)
and this updates the database, if successful, it returns an 'ok' message. If not, it returns a 'Bad Response' message. We then check the response and
if it's 'ok', we proceed to update the store with the data from the form. If not, we throw an error.

This is a good illustration (in my opinion) of how you can use the `context` object to share data between your routes and your worker thread.

## API

### API Reference

By default, the `context` object ships with some utilities that you can use in your worker thread.

```ts
/* within the worker-runtime (under the hood) */
function createContext(event: FetchEvent) {
  const context = /*...*/.getLoadContext?.(event) || {}; // exported from worker file

  return {
    event,
    fetchFromServer: () => fetch(event.request.clone()),
    ...context
  };
}
```

- `event` - The `FetchEvent` object
- `fetchFromServer` - A function that passes the request onto the server (`fetch(request.clone())`)
- `...context` - The rest of the `context` object returned from `getLoadContext` (whatever else you export)

Note, you can override these with your own defaults too. For example:

```ts {{ filename:'entry.worker.ts' }}
import type { GetLoadContextFunction } from "@remix-pwa/sw";

export const getLoadContext: GetLoadContextFunction = () => {
  return {
    fetchFromServer: ({ action, data }) =>
      fetch(action, {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(data)
      }),
    foo: "bar",
    key: "value"
  };
};
```
