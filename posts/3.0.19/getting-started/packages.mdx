## `@remix-pwa/dev`

This is the heart of Remix PWA. Ships with the compiler and the dev server as well as CLI engine, this is the package that makes everything work.

## `@remix-pwa/worker-runtime`

This contains the default [runtime](/docs/technical-explanation#runtimes) for Remix PWA. It's a small package that contains the internal service worker 
and handlers for the default runtime.

## `@remix-pwa/cache`

This is a very thin wrapper around the browser's `CacheStorage` & `Cache` API. It is used like the normal cache but it also adds a few extra features like
the ability to cache a response for a specific time (cache expiration) and LRU behaviour.

## `@remix-pwa/sw`

The main factory house for Remix PWA. Ships with a lot less than v2 but still as important. Contains typings for the worker as well as utilities like hooks and
`LiveReload`, worker messaging handler and more.

## `@remix-pwa/strategy`

The new breakaway from `@remix-pwa/sw`. This package contains all the strategies that ships with Remix PWA with a new one added to the mix: `StaleWhileRevalidate`.

The strategy format has also changed. Read on more to find out how and why.

## `@remix-pwa/sync`

The Background Sync API is a new API that allows you to defer actions until the user has stable connectivity. This package contains the utilities to make
this work with Remix PWA. Heavily inspired by Workbox implementation, we have made it a lot easier to use as well as standalone so you can use it in your service worker file
and routes alike.

## `@remix-pwa/client`

This package contains the client side utilities for Remix PWA. It ships with a lot of APIs to help with native components like clipboard, connectivity, sharing, contacts, etc.
