This document attempts to answer the simple, yet not-so-simple question of: "What on earth did Remix PWA v3 become?", or in more formal terms:
"What are the technical details of Remix PWA v3.0?". This document is intended for developers who want to understand the technical details of Remix PWA v3. 

I like to describe Remix PWA as one of such:

- A compiler
- A CLI (Command Line Interface) executable
- A service worker framework

---

## Technical Details

### Compiler

Everything in Remix PWA starts with a compiler: `remix-pwa build`. Using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), this does a few things:

- Using your selected [worker runtime](#runtimes), it compiles your worker code into a single file using the `remix.config.js` file as the configuration.
- Exposes the worker thread to your Remix routes. This is done by emptying out all routes save for the `workerLoader` and `workerAction` functions, 
and then building a map out of that. This map is then used by the worker thread to know which route to load for a given request as well as replicate Remix's parent-child relationships
that loaders & actions have.
- Builds all your Remix routes (based on a manifest graph), extracts all `workerLoader` and `workerAction` functions, then bundles them into the built worker file.
- Creates a worker build. By default, this is in `public/entry.worker.js` (can be changed from your Remix configuration file).
- Creates a worker routes and asset manifest. This is a global map available to the worker thread that allows it to know which route to load for a given request
as well as generate a dependency graph and resource map for the worker to use.

### CLI

The CLI is a simple executable that is used to run the compiler, as well as a few other things:

- `remix-pwa init`: Creates a new Remix PWA project. Alternatively, you can use `new` or `create` as well. This is the default command (soon to be deprecated).
- `remix-pwa build`: Runs the compiler in `build` mode.
- `remix-pwa dev`: Runs the compiler in `dev` mode. This is a special mode that is used to run the compiler in watch mode,
as well as reloads your application (via `@remix-pwa/sw` `LiveReload` component)

Check out the full guide [here](/docs/remix-pwa-dev-cli)

### Service Worker Framework

Service Worker Framework is a term that hasn't been officially defined yet, but it's a term I use to describe Remix PWA.

It is a framework in the sense that you have a compiler that builds your service worker, a set of configurations that decide how your service worker is built and behaves,
as well as an output which is the built product in the form of a service worker in the `public` directory.

Remix PWA offers you all these three at the basic level as well as high level APIs that assists you in building your ultimate service worker.

## Runtimes

### Vanilla JS Runtime

The vanilla JS runtime is the default runtime for Remix PWA. It is packed into `@remix-pwa/worker-runtime` and is used by default 
when you run `remix-pwa build` (to change this, update the `worker` file in your `remix.config.js` file). 

This is comprised of a few things, the most important of which are:

- A `defaultFetchHandler` function that is used to handle all fetch requests by default, when a `workerLoader` or `workerAction` isn't found. 
- A `getLoadContext` generator function that is used to generate `context` for a given request.
- A `defualtErrorHandler` function that is used to handle all errors by default. You can override them by the way by exporting from your own service worker file.
- Finally, and most importantly, a `ServiceWorkerGlobalScope` `fetch` event listener. This is the main event listener that is used to handle all requests.

> *Please, whatever you do or see,* **never** *override the `fetch` event listener.*

<Info>
In Remix PWA, a runtime is basically a JavaScript file that acts as your underlying service worker. Think of it like your Remix `entry.client` or
`entry.server` file, but for your service worker.

### Workbox Runtime

This is a runtime for using Workbox with Remix PWA v3.0. It is currently in development and will be released soon (idk how soon though).
