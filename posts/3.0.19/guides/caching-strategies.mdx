If you've been a user of Remix PWA, you'll know that strategies are not a new thing. It's something Workbox does too, and is a common
approach for caching in web applications for a while even though some don't even know they are ustilizing a strategy. Remix PWA does 
nothing exactly new, but we did add some sugar to make it easier to use.

## Caching Strategies

### Remix PWA v3.0 implementation

If you've used Remix PWA v2.0, caching looked something like this:

```ts
const dataHandler = new NetworkFirst(/* ... */);
const assetHandler = new CacheFirst(/* ... */);
// and so on.
```

where you create an instance of a `Strategy` and then using your `fetch` event handler and a bit of request mix-and-matching, detect what type
of request is being made and react with the appropriate strategy.

In Remix PWA v3.0, thanks to the expansion of Service Workers across your application, plus, we wanted to reduce the reliance on strategy caching
for any bit of caching, we tweaked the way you strategy is handled. First of, instead of a bulk instance that monitors every request, you can now
use it for just a single request (like in a `workerLoader` for example) or use it to monitor a whole set of requests (like in your `defaultFetchHandler`).

<Snippet>

```ts {{ filename:'entry.worker.ts' }}
import { cacheFirst } from '@remix-pwa/strategy';

// I can use it to monitor a whole load of requests
const assetHandler = cacheFirst(/* ... */);

export const defaultFetchHandler = ({ context }) => {
  // la la la. some nightmarish code...

  if (request.url.includes('/assets/')) {
    // This caches every request that has `/assets/` in the URL
    // using a cache first strategy - which means, if the cache 
    // is available, use it, otherwise fetch from the network 
    // and cache it.
    //
    // we pass in the context `request` because we want the
    // raw URL instead of stripped.
    return cacheFirstHandler(context.event.request)
  }

  // a terrible PR by an intern lives beyond this point
}
```

```tsx {{ filename:'app/routes/profile.tsx' }}
import { staleWhileRevalidate } from '@remix-pwa/strategy';

// loader function right here...

export const workerLoader = ({ context }) => {
  // ...

  const cachifier = staleWhileRevalidate(/* ... */);

  try {
    // This is a fancy `fetchFromServer` function.
    // It takes in your request, and not only fetches
    // it from the server, but also caches it in the
    // background.
    const response = await cachifier(context.event.request);

    // do something with the response
  } catch (error) {
    // error handling
  }

  // ...
}

// rest of the route code...
```

</Snippet>

We have two very different use-cases above. One is a global fetch handler that monitors every request and caches it if it matches a certain criteria.
The second is a very specific use-case in a very specific route for a very specific request. Both of them use the same strategy, but in different ways.

This was our goal. This is the power of Remix PWA v3.0. You can use the same strategy in different ways, it's all up to you and your use-case.

### Mini API Reference

To avoid repetition, there are some common interfaces and types that are used across all strategies. Let's go through them first.

Firstly, all strategies tale in few options, some of them extend the interface but the base interface is as follows:

```ts
interface StrategyOptions {
  cache: string | RemixCache;
  cacheOptions?: Omit<RemixCacheOptions, 'name'>;
  cacheQueryOptions?: CacheQueryOptions;
}
```

The options can be surmised as:

- **`cache`**: This is the name of the cache you want to use. It could also be a `RemixCache` instance, provided by `Storage.open()`. *Required.*
- **`cacheOptions`**: If you are creating a cache on the fly, you can pass in the options for the cache here. *Optional.*
- **`cacheQueryOptions`**: If you want to customize the way the cache is queried, you can pass in the options here, more info on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache/match#parameters). *Optional.*

Secondly, all strategies follow the following interface:

```
type StrategyResponse = (request: Request) => Promise<Response>

interface Strategy {
  (options: T extends StrategyOptions): StrategyResponse;
}
```

<Info>
`T` above doesn't mean anything, it's just a placeholder for the type of options the strategy takes in. For example, `cacheFirst` takes in `CacheFirstOptions` and `networkFirst` takes in `NetworkFirstOptions`
both of which extend `StrategyOptions`.
</Info>

Every strategy handler returns a function that takes in a `Request` and returns a `Promise<Response>`. It is this function that then does the heavy lifting of caching and fetching.

### Network First

This is the de-facto, default for a lot of applications. Attempt to fetch the resource from the network, and if it fails, fallback to the cache.

In Remix PWA and PWAs in general, heck in web applications in general, this is the most common and default strategy. It's very straight-forward, easy to understand
and implement and is the most common use-case. Nothing much more to be said.

```ts
networkFirst({
  cache: string | RemixCache;
  cacheOptions?: Omit<RemixCacheOptions, 'name'>;
  cacheQueryOptions?: CacheQueryOptions;
  fetchDidFail?: (() => void | (() => Promise<void>))[] | undefined;
  fetchDidSucceed?: (() => void | (() => Promise<void>))[] | undefined;
  networkTimeoutSeconds?: number;
});
```

It takes in a few options (which extends [`StrategyOptions`](/docs/caching-strategies#mini-api-reference)) that you can use to customize your strategy. Let's go through them one by one.

- **`fetchDidFail`**: A callback that is called when the fetch fails, can pass in your background sync queue function, or logger, etc. *Optional.*
- **`fetchDidSucceed`**: A callback that is called when the fetch succeeds. *Optional.*
- **`networkTimeoutSeconds`**: The number of seconds to wait for the network to respond before falling back to the cache. *Optional.*

### Cache First

This is the second most common strategy. Attempt to fetch the resource from the cache, and if it fails, fallback to the network.

```ts
cacheFirst({
  cache: string | RemixCache;
  cacheOptions?: Omit<RemixCacheOptions, 'name'>;
  cacheQueryOptions?: CacheQueryOptions;
  fetchDidFail?: (() => void | (() => Promise<void>))[] | undefined;
});
```

This takes in just one extra options, and that's `fetchDidFail` which is the same as `networkFirst` above.

### Cache Only

This is the third most common strategy. Attempt to fetch the resource from the cache, and if it fails, 
returns undefined (usually a `400` or `404`). In other words, always make sure the resource is persisted in cache.

```ts
cacheOnly({
  cache: string | RemixCache;
  cacheOptions?: Omit<RemixCacheOptions, 'name'>;
  cacheQueryOptions?: CacheQueryOptions;
});
```

This takes in no extra options. Nothing special here.

### Network Only

This is the default of your default `fetch` (to be honest, I have no idea why you would reach for this strategy, but it's here for completeness sake).
Attempt to fetch the resource from the network, and if it fails, return undefined (usually an error `500` is returned).

```ts
networkOnly({
  fetchDidFail?: (() => void | (() => Promise<void>))[] | undefined;
  fetchDidSucceed?: (() => void | (() => Promise<void>))[] | undefined;
  networkTimeoutSeconds?: number;
});
```

This takes in the same options as `networkFirst` above. The difference is that it doesn't cache at any point in time.

### Stale While Revalidate (SWR)

The new homeboy in town 🤠. This is a very powerful strategy that is used in a lot of applications. It's a combination of `cacheFirst` and `networkFirst`.
The SWR caching strategy is like having your cake and eating it too. It serves a cached version of your content (stale) while fetching a fresh one in the 
background (revalidate). This keeps your app feeling snappy while ensuring your users always get the latest updates.

```ts
staleWhileRevalidate({
  cache: string | RemixCache;
  cacheOptions?: Omit<RemixCacheOptions, 'name'>;
  cacheQueryOptions?: CacheQueryOptions;
  fetchDidFail?: (() => void | (() => Promise<void>))[] | undefined;
});
```

This takes in the same options as `cacheFirst` above. The difference is that it fetches from the network in the background and updates the cache.

The benefits of SWR is huge. For one, since you are serving from cache, you get maintain a snappy, responsive user interface. Secondly, you are always
fetching from the network in the background and caching, so you are always up-to-date and never get stale data. And finally, it is efficient, you are
not fetching from the network on every request, you are only fetching when the cache is stale.
