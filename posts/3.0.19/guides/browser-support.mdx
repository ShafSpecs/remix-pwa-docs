First thing of note, Remix PWA (like Remix) only runs on browsers that support ES Modules. Secondly, browsers that don't support Service Workers
are incompatible with Remix PWA.

## Feature-by-Feature Approach

What this means is that although Remix PWA ships with **a lot** of features, not all of them are available on all browsers. I recommend a
feature-by-feature approach meaning before implementing any major API (like Background Sync, WakeLock, QR Code Scanning 👀, etc.), confirm
wether it is supported on the browsers you are targeting. 

You can use [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com) to check for browser support. For example, if you want to use the [WakeLock API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WakeLock), you can search for it on caniuse.com and see that it is only supported on browsers
except Firefox (even Safari supports it, come on Mozilla 🙄).
