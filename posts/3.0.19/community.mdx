The Remix PWA community isn't a separate community, but one embedded into the Remix community. 
A community that's all about devs hanging out and having fun while building cool stuff for the web.

To that end, please keep in my our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/remix-pwa/monorepo/blob/dev/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Support

### Discord

The [Remix Discord Server](https://rmx.as/discord) is one of the best place to get help, chat about ideas, approaches and generally anything. 
A lot of the Remix community are also quite active in there (including me, don't be afraid to ping!).

### Github Discussions

Github discussion forum is also another great place to converse with the team and other Remix devs about anything Remix/PWA related. We are always happy to help.

### StackOverflow

If you have a question that you think might be useful to others, or you want to get help from the wider community, StackOverflow is a great place to ask questions.

### Definitely not Twitter

Heading is enough...
