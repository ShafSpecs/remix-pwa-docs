## Runtime

### Official Adapters

Remix PWA v3.0 is built to be as agnostic as possible when it comes to tools you can use to handle Service Workers. Because of this,
we separated the uderlying Service Worker logic from the rest of the library, and created a set of adapters that you can use to
integrate Remix PWA with your favorite Service Worker tool and plug into this logic.

- `@remix-pwa/worker-runtime` - Fondly called 'Vanilla JS Runtime', this is the official adapter for vanilla JS Service Workers with no underlying tool like Workbox and also the default runtime for Remix PWA.

### Community Adapters

None

### Creating your own runtime

<Info>
This section is still under construction. Creating your own runtime depends on some APIs that are still prone to breaking changes.

If you want to create your own runtime, please refer to the source code of the [official runtime](https://github.com/remix-pwa/monorepo/blob/main/packages/worker-runtime/src).
</Info>

If you want to create your own runtime, it is made up of a few major components:

- `createContext` - This is a function that creates the global `context` object that is passed to across the worker.
- A `fetch` event listener - This is the event listener that handles all `fetch` events. This is your handler that handles everything that happens when a request is made.

You also want to add a way to handle the `defaultfetchHandler` and `errorHandler` exported from the user's worker file. 

> *More info and examples coming soon.*

You might be interested in the fact that runtimes in Remix PWA are basically just Service Workers under the hood. Via some simple, yet not simple 
methods, we are able to create a Service Worker that is not only agnostic to the underlying tool, but also to the environment it is running in 
and is a combination of your entry worker file + router worker exports (`workerLoader` & `workerAction`).
