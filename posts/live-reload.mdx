## `LiveReload`

This component is a reimplementation of Remix [`LiveReload`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/components/live-reload) component but
with support for Remix PWA. It performs the same function as the original component, but it also updates the service worker
when the browser detects a new version of the service worker (e.g when a change is made to a route with the worker thread present in it).

```tsx {{ filename:'root.tsx' }}
import { LiveReload } from "@remix-pwa/sw";

export default function Root() {
  return (
    <html>
      <head />
      <body>
        <LiveReload />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```
