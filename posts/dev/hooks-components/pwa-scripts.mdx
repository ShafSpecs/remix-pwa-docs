The `PWAScripts` component from `@remix-pwa/sw` is a component that allows for custom registration of service worker scripts. 

<Info>

`injectSWRegister` **must** be set to `false` in your Vite config for this component to work.

</Info>

It takes in the following optional props, in addition to the standard `HTMLProps<HTMLScriptElement>`:

- `registrationScope` - The scope of the service worker registration.
- `serviceWorkerType` - Wether the service worker is a classic or module worker.
- `workerName` - The name of the worker, **without the `.js` extension**. Defaults to `entry.worker`.

```ts {{ filename:'app/root.tsx' }}
import { PWAScripts } from "@remix-pwa/sw/pwa-scripts";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <head>
      <PWAScripts />
    </head>
  )
}
```
