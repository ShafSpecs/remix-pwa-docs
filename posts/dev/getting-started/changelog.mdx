A lot has changed in Remix PWA v5. New Remix features, React Router v7, faster builds, a new package and more.

In this log, we would be exploring these changes part by part, allowing you to see the bigger picture of what exactly has changed.

## `@remix-pwa/dev`

The most important package within Remix PWA, responsible for building the service worker and making it easier to integrate with your Remix app.

### Addition of `injectSWRegister` option

The `injectSWRegister` option is used to automatically inject the service worker registration code into your app. By default this is enabled, you can disable to handle the registration
by yourself.

### Deprecation of `registerSW` option

The `registerSW` option has been deprecated and would be removed in a future version. It has been replaced by the `injectSWRegister` option.

### Removal of the `WebAppManifest` export

This has been moved to the `@remix-pwa/manifest` package.

### Support for Remix SPA mode and Single Fetch

Remix PWA now supports both Remix SPA mode and Single Fetch. This drastically alters the behaviour of Remix PWA and how it handles the service worker.
Check out the [SPA](/docs/dev/spa) and [Single Fetch](/docs/dev/single-fetch) docs for more information.

Some of the less obvious changes include faster build times and smaller service worker sizes

## `@remix-pwa/worker-manifest`

The main runtime of Remix PWA. Provides a common foundation for service worker to be built upon.

### Support for SPA Mode

Provides a different behaviour if the app is a Single-Page Application (SPA). This allows you to switch apps from SSR to SPA and vice-versa with very little overhead.

### Support for Single Fetch

Also provides in-built compatibility with single fetch behaviour. This includes disabling worker routes modules.

### Incremental support for React Router

> This is an unstable feature that's still a work-in-progress

This is mainly by slowly pulling out of Remix internal modules and adopting more react-router-friendly approach when dealing with application's code.

## `@remix-pwa/sw`

The main toolbox of Remix PWA. Contains main modules, utilities and functions to supercharge your Remix app!

### Better tree-shaking

`sw` package now ships with more exports, to avoid importing the entire library when you require one or two features

**For example:**

```ts {{ filename:'app/exports.ts' }}
// Before
import { Logger } from "@remix-pwa/sw";

// After
import { Logger } from "@remix-pwa/sw/logger";
```

### `PWAScripts` component

A requested feature, allowing you to register your service worker with custom script options. Ensure that `injectSWRegister` is set to false, else errors would be thrown.

```ts {{ filename:'app/root.tsx' }}
import { PWAScripts } from "@remix-pwa/sw/pwa-scripts"

// within your app
<head>
  <Meta />
  <Links />
  // Custom options
  <PWAScripts
    nonce={undefined}
    crossOrigin="use-credentials"
    serviceWorkerType="module"
  />
</head>
```

### `installPWAGlobals` hook

A new hook that replaces `useSWEffect` hook. All round, better, faster and more concise. Doesn't take in any options, ensure that it's at the top of your root component.

```ts {{ filename:'app/root.tsx' }}
import { installPWAGlobals } from "@remix-pwa/sw/install-pwa-globals";

export default function App() {
  installPWAGlobals();

  return (...)
}
```

### Removal of `useSWEffect` hook

This has been replaced by the `installPWAGlobals` hook.

### Removal of `ManifestLink` component

This has been moved to the [`@remix-pwa/manifest`](/docs/dev/changelog#remix-pwa-manifest) package.

### Reoval of message sending utilities

This includes `sendSkipWaitingMessage` and `SkipWaitHandler`. This have been trimmed entirely from the library, with you being responsible for handling the service worker updates yourself.

### Removal of `loadServiceWorker`

A deprecated method of Remix PWA, this has been removed entirely. Replaced with the `PWAScripts` component and the Vite plugin.

## `@remix-pwa/manifest`

A new package added to Remix PWA library collection. The reason for this was to provide a modular distinction between the manifest and the service worker.

### `ManifestLink` component

This component has been moved to this package from the `@remix-pwa/sw` package. With one crucial change, the `manifestUrl` prop has been replaced with `href` prop.

```ts {{ filename:'app/root.tsx' }}
import { ManifestLink } from "@remix-pwa/manifest/manifest-link";

<ManifestLink href="/manifest.json" />
```

### `WebAppManifest` type export

This has been moved to this package from the `@remix-pwa/dev` package. This is a type that allows you to type your manifest object.

<Heading level={3} ignore>ü•ö Schema Definition</Heading>

An easter egg I sneaked in. This is a JSON schema definition for the manifest object. If you prefer to use a `manifest.json` file within the public directory but still
want to benefit from the type safety of Remix PWA, this is for you.

```json {{ filename:'public/manifest.json' }}
{
  "$schema": "https://remix-pwa.run/manifest.schema.json",
  // Alternatively, you can use the schema from the package
  "$schema": "@remix-pwa/manifest/schema.json",
  "name": "Remix PWA",
  "short_name": "Remix PWA",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#000000",
  "theme_color": "#000000"
}
```

## `@remix-pwa/push`

The push notification stop for Remix PWA. Nothing much happened here, jsut fixed a major blunder and a few utilities.

### üõ†Ô∏è `sendNotifications` fix

Thanks to [Alexandre](https://github.com/Superalexandre) for reporting this [issue](https://github.com/remix-pwa/monorepo/issues/271). Previously, when sending notifications,
it was impossible to know which failed and which didn't. Also, when a subscription was expired or not found (non-existent user), the entire process would throw an error.

This has been fixed by attempting each subscription individually, and returning a list of `NotificationResult` objects.

### `getNotificationResults` function

A utility to filter and refactor a list of `NotificationResult` objects into a more readable format.
