Remix PWA is a collection of libraries that makes it easy to integrate Progressive Web App (PWA) features into your Remix project. This guide would walk you through the process of setting up a PWA in your Remix project.

## Prerequisites

- Remix project that utilises Remix version 2.8 or higher
- Node.js version 20 or higher
- Vite

## Installation

Installing Remix PWA can be done via:

```bash
npm i --save-dev @remix-pwa/dev
# main packages for service worker and manifest
npm i --save @remix-pwa/worker-runtime @remix-pwa/manifest
```

<Info>
  Remix PWA scaffolding CLI is still under development and would be released soon.
</Info>

Of course you would need to install some more packages to leverage the full power of PWAs but we are talking bare minimum here and that's it,
that's all you need to get started.

## Setting Up

To add Remix PWA to your app, simply add it to your `vite.config.ts` file:

```ts {{ filename: 'vite.config.ts' }}
import { remixPWA } from '@remix-pwa/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    // other plugins,
    remixPWA(),
  ],
})
```

The options for the `remixPWA` plugin can be found [here](/docs/dev/vite-config).

To create a service worker, you can use the `remix-pwa` CLI:

```bash
npx remix-pwa sw
```

This creates an `entry.worker.ts` file in your `app` folder. Although, the service worker is quite useless and doesn't do anything
asides installing and activating itself, it is good to go ðŸ˜„.

To make your app installable, you would need to add a manifest file. You can use the `remix-pwa` CLI to generate one:

```bash
npx remix-pwa manifest
```

That's it! You have successfully set up a basic Remix PWA project.
