`workerAction` lets you handle non-GET requests right in your route files. Think of it as your route's personal service worker - perfect for offline-first features, request interception, or background syncing.

## workerAction

### Synopsis

Need to queue up form submissions when offline? Want to sync data in the background? `workerAction` lets you handle these scenarios right where they belong - in your route files.

### Usage

Here's a practical example of handling offline form submissions:

```tsx {{filename:'app/routes/todos.tsx'}}
import type { WorkerActionArgs } from "@remix-pwa/sw";
import type { ActionFunctionArgs } from "@remix-run/node";
import { json, redirect } from "@remix-run/node";
import { json as swJson } from "@remix-pwa/sw/utils";

export async function action({ request }: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  const formData = await request.formData();
  const todo = await db.todos.create({
    title: formData.get("title")
  });
  return redirect(`/todos/${todo.id}`);
}

export async function workerAction({ context }: WorkerActionArgs) {
  const { fetchFromServer } = context;

  try {
    const response = await fetchFromServer();
    if (response.ok) return response;
  } catch (err) {
    // Queue for background sync when offline
    await queueToServer({
      name: "todoSync",
      request: context.event.request.clone()
    });

    return swJson({ 
      message: "We'll save this when you're back online!",
      queued: true 
    });
  }
}
```

### SPA Mode

In SPA mode, `workerAction` becomes your primary data handler, they become actions to your `clientAction`. Here's a simple example of how you might handle a counter increment (a contrived example, but it shows the point):

```tsx {{filename:'app/routes/counter.tsx'}}
// Worker intercepts the request and adds 1
export async function workerAction({ request }: WorkerActionArgs) {
  const data = await request.json();
  return json({ 
    count: data.count + 1 
  });
}

// Client makes a request that gets intercepted
export async function clientAction({ request }: ClientActionFunctionArgs) {
  const response = await fetch('/counter', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ count: 5 })
  });
  
  return response.json();
}
```

### Single-Fetch Apps

In single-fetch setups, `workerAction` does not work. It is disabled, and all requests intercepted are handled by the `defaultFetchHandler`.

## API

### Arguments

Your `workerAction` receives:

```ts
interface WorkerActionArgs {
  context: AppLoadContext;  // Your worker's global context
  params: Params;           // Route parameters
  request: Request;         // The incoming request
}
```

### `workerAction` vs `action`

| Feature | `workerAction` | `action` |
|:--------|:---------------|:---------|
| Runs in | Service Worker | Server |
| Access to | Browser APIs, Caches, IndexedDB | Server resources, Database |
| Best for | Offline support, Request interception | Data mutations, Auth |
| Can use | `fetch`, `cache`, Client APIs | Server-side code, Database queries |
