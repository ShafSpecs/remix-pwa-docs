First things first, we are humans. That means errors would occur and problems would arise. Smart people put this in mind when building anything
and plan ahead for it. In programming it's called Error Handling. In Remix PWA, it's your safety net - the `errorHandler`.

The `errorHandler` function is your service worker's last line of defense. It catches any errors that slip through the cracks during the 
request-response cycle (whether that's during fetching, caching, or responding to requests). Think of it as your application's cleanup crew - 
always ready to handle the unexpected.

## Error Handling

Currently, the `errorHandler` is a straightforward function that takes in an error and returns `void` (it can return something, but it would be ignored). 
The error is of type `Error`, and it's your ticket to understanding what went wrong. You can use this to log errors, ping error tracking services, or 
handle the situation however you see fit.

### Basic Error Handling

```ts {{ filename:'entry.worker.ts' }}
export function errorHandler(error: Error) {
  console.error('‚ö° Something went wrong in your worker:', error);
}
```

### Advanced Error Handling

Here's a more practical example that handles different types of errors and reports them accordingly:

```ts {{ filename:'entry.worker.ts' }}
export function errorHandler(error: Error) {
  // You could use error types to handle different scenarios
  if (error instanceof TypeError) {
    // Handle network errors, failed fetches, etc
    console.error('üåê Network Error:', error.message);
    // Maybe trigger a background sync
    // registerSync('failed-requests');
    return;
  }

  if (error instanceof CacheError) { // Your custom error type
    // Handle cache-related errors
    console.error('üì¶ Cache Error:', error.message);
    // Maybe clear problematic cache
    // caches.delete('problematic-cache');
    return;
  }

  // You could integrate with error tracking services
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
    reportErrorToService(error);
  }

  // Log all other errors
  console.error('‚ö° Worker Error:', {
    name: error.name,
    message: error.message,
    stack: error.stack,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
}

// Helper function for production error reporting
function reportErrorToService(error: Error) {
  // Example with a hypothetical error service
  fetch('https://your-error-service.com/api/errors', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: error.name,
      message: error.message,
      stack: error.stack,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    })
  }).catch(console.error); // Handle reporting errors silently
}
```
