In a default (, de-facto) Remix application, whenever you make a request to a URL or route, the browser will make a request to the server and return the response.
That is simple a `fetch(request)` call. Service Workers are a middle layer between the browser and the server, so they intercept requests being made by the browser
and can respond to them themselves. Meaning, the service worker determines how the browser makes calls and what it recieves.

In comes `defaultFetchHandler`. This is a handler exported from your service worker that Remix PWA will use to handle all requests from routes without [`workerLoader`](/docs/worker-loader)
or [`workerAction`](/docs/worker-action). If you have used Remix PWA before, think of this as your normal fetch handler that you pass to the Service Worker `fetch` event handler.

---

## Basic Usage

### Basic browser fetching

```ts {{ filename:'entry.worker.ts' }}
export const defaultFetchHandler = async ({ request }) => {
  return fetch(request);
};
```

At the most basic level, you can just return the fetch request. This will make the browser fetch the request as normal. This is how a standard Remix application works.

But this is boring, and we want to do more with our service worker. So let's look at something a bit more.

### A little bit of caching

We can throw in some caching to make our application a bit faster. We can use the `cache` object to cache our requests. This is a simple key-value store that we can use to store
responses from our server. We can then use the `cache.match` method to check if we have a cached response for a request. If we do, we can return that response, otherwise we can
fetch the request and cache the response.

```ts {{ filename:'entry.worker.ts' }}
import type { WorkerDataFunctionArgs } from "@remix-pwa/sw";

export const defaultFetchHandler = async ({ request }: WorkerDataFunctionArgs) => {
  if (request.method.toUpperCase() !== "GET") 
    return fetch(request);

  const cache = await caches.open("remix-pwa");
  const cachedResponse = await cache.match(request);

  if (cachedResponse) 
    return cachedResponse;

  const response = await fetch(request);
  await cache.put(request, response.clone());

  return response;
};
```

This now caches every single `GET` request that is made to the server and returns that cached response (this would cause stale data to pile though!). By now, you should have a very good 
idea of how this works, you can expand this to do much more crazy things; like cache certain resources, rate limit requests, background syncing, etc. It is a very powerful tool.

<Info>
In summary, `defaultFetchHandler` is an exported handler from your service worker file that handles all incoming requests from your application
and runs solely in the service worker. It is a fallback for all requests that are not handled by [`workerLoader`](/docs/worker-loader) or [`workerAction`](/docs/worker-action).

## API

### `request`

This is a [Fetch Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) instance. Read up the MDN docs to learn more about it.

The most common use case for this is actually fetching the request, reading cookies, getting URLs or caching a particular route:

```ts
export const defaultFetchHandler = async ({ request }) => {
  // get the request method
  const method = request.method;

  // read a cookie
  const cookie = request.headers.get("Cookie");

  // parse the search params for `?filter=`
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  const query = url.searchParams.get("filter");
};
```

<Warn>
Remix PWA strips down the `request` object and removes the `_data` property (like Remix)

If you want to access the original request, you can use `context.event.request` instead.
</Warn>

### `params`

Route params are defined by route file names. If a segment begins with `$` like `$invoiceId`, the value from the URL for that segment will be passed to your fetch handler (just like Remix!).

```ts {{ filename: 'entry.worker.ts' }}
export const defaultFetchHandler = async ({ request, params }) => {
  // if the route is `/invoice/:invoiceId`
  // and the URL is `/invoice/123`
  // then params.invoiceId will be `123`
  const invoiceId = params.invoiceId;
};
```

### `context`

This is the context passed into your fetch handlers via Remix PWA's [`getLoadContext`](/docs/get-load-context) function. This is a very powerful tool that allows you to pass data
around the worker thread. A simple `getLoadContext` example:

```ts {{ filename: 'entry.worker.ts' }}
import type { GetLoadContextFunction } from "@remix-pwa/sw";

export const getLoadContext: GetLoadContextFunction = async (event: fetchEvent) => {
  const { request } = event;
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  const query = url.searchParams.get("filter");

  // Assuming for some weird reason, you are filtering on almost all your routes.
  return { filterQuery: query };
};
```

And you can utilise this in your fetch handler:

```ts {{ filename: 'entry.worker.ts' }}
export const defaultFetchHandler = async ({ request, context }) => {
  const { filterQuery } = context;

  // do something with filterQuery
};
```

<Info>
Remix PWA models its Route APIs after Remix's own. So `context`, `params` and `request` are no much different from how you approach
them in `action`s or `loader`s.

## TypeScript Support

### Type Safety

Remix PWA utilises a TypeScript-first approach. This means that all the APIs are typed and you get full type safety when using them.
A few types to assist with `defaultFetchHandler` are shipped with the `@remix-pwa/sw` package:

```ts
// The type of the `defaultFetchHandler` handler itself
type GetLoadContextFunction = (event: FetchEvent) => WorkerLoadContext;
```
