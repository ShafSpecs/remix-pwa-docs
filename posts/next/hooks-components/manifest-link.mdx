The ManifestLink component from `@remix-pwa/manifest` is a utility component to help with registering a manifest file.

Utilise it just above Remix's `<Links />` component within your app's root.

It takes two optional props: 

- `href` which is the URL to your manifest file. By default, this is `/manifest.webmanifest`.
- `crossOrigin` which is the cross origin attribute for the link tag.

```ts {{ filename:'app/root.tsx' }}
import { ManifestLink } from "@remix-pwa/manifest/manifest-link";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <...>
      <ManifestLink href="/manifest.json" />
      <Links />
    </...>
  )
}
```
