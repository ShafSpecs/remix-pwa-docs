The `installPWAGlobals` hook is a hook that manages the service worker-client synchronization. It handles sending messages to the service worker on navigation
events, also handling `workerLoader` and `workerAction` behaviour within SPA applications.

It must be placed at the top of your root component.

<Info>

This hook is **required** in an SPA application. And also if you intend to use a service worker.

</Info>

```ts {{ filename:'app/root.tsx' }}
import { installPWAGlobals } from "@remix-pwa/sw/install-pwa-globals";

export default function App() {
  installPWAGlobals();

  return (...)
}
```
