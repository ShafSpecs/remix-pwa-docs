Remix PWA v5 is a major milestone built upon v4. It is built to work with Remix latest features, as well as prepare for React Router v7.

Upgrading to v5 doesn't require a lot of work. The main thing you would need to do is to upgrade your `@remix-pwa/*` packages to the latest `v5.x.x` version. There are also a few breaking changes that you would need to be aware of.
Check out the [changelog](/docs/next/changelog) for more details.

## Upgrading from v4 to v5

To upgrade from v4 to v5, you would first need to make sure your Remix application is a Vite one. That means no `remix.config.js` and
a `@remix-run/*` version of at least `^2.8.1`.

Once you've done that, upgrade your `@remix-pwa/*` packages to the latest `dev` tag with using Remix PWA CLI:

```bash
npx remix-pwa@latest upgrade -D
```

<Info>
  Remix PWA v5 is still in nightly release, that means installing using the `dev` tag and not the `latest` tag to install.
</Info>

### Updating the Config

In case you are using the `registerSW` option in your `vite.config.ts` file, you would need to update it to the new `injectSWRegister` option as it has been deprecated.

```ts {{ filename: 'vite.config.ts' }}
import { remixPWA } from '@remix-pwa/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    // other plugins,
    remixPWA({
      injectSWRegister: true, // boolean
    }),
  ],
})
```

### Updating the Service Worker

In v4, we had the `useSWEffect` hook that we used to link our service worker to the client. In v5, this has been replaced by the `installPWAGlobals` hook.

A smaller, more efficient and less-bloated hook that does the same thing (and more).

```ts {{ filename: 'app/root.tsx' }}
// ðŸ”¥ Better tree-shaking!
import { installPWAGlobals } from '@remix-pwa/sw/install-pwa-globals';

export default function App() {
  installPWAGlobals();
  
  // my app...
}
```
