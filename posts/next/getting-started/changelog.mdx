A lot has changed in Remix PWA v5. New Remix features, React Router v7, faster builds, a new package and more.

In this log, we would be exploring these changes part by part, allowing you to see the bigger picture of what exactly has changed.

## `@remix-pwa/dev`

The most important package within Remix PWA, responsible for building the service worker and making it easier to integrate with your Remix app.

### Addition of `injectSWRegister` option

The `injectSWRegister` option is used to automatically inject the service worker registration code into your app. By default this is enabled, you can disable to handle the registration
by yourself.

### Deprecation of `registerSW` option

The `registerSW` option has been deprecated and would be removed in a future version. It has been replaced by the `injectSWRegister` option.

### Removal of the `WebAppManifest` export

This has been moved to the `@remix-pwa/manifest` package.

### Support for Remix SPA mode and Single Fetch

Remix PWA now supports both Remix SPA mode and Single Fetch. This drastically alters the behaviour of Remix PWA and how it handles the service worker.
Check out the [SPA](/docs/next/spa) and [Single Fetch](/docs/next/single-fetch) docs for more information.

Some of the less obvious changes include faster build times and smaller service worker sizes
