A lot has changed in Remix PWA v5. New Remix features, React Router v7, faster builds, a new package and more.

In this log, we would be exploring these changes part by part, allowing you to see the bigger picture of what exactly has changed.

## `@remix-pwa/dev`

The most important package within Remix PWA, responsible for building the service worker and making it easier to integrate with your Remix app.

<Heading level={4}>Addition of `injectSWRegister` option</Heading>

The `injectSWRegister` option is used to automatically inject the service worker registration code into your app. By default this is enabled, you can disable to handle the registration
by yourself.

<Heading level={4}>Deprecation of `registerSW` option</Heading>

The `registerSW` option has been deprecated and would be removed in a future version. It has been replaced by the `injectSWRegister` option.

<Heading level={4}>Removal of the `WebAppManifest` export</Heading>

This has been moved to the `@remix-pwa/manifest` package.
