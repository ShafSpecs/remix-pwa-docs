import Info from './info.tsx';

We have built a fully functional push handler that works just fine, but what if
we want to add some custom functionality during any of the stages of a push notification? For example,
we want to log the interactions users have with our push notifications in order to create a
map. Or we want to translate the push notification message to the user's language when a push is recieved.
Or take it to the next level and create a background sync queue that queues messages when the user is offline.
All of that would require us to create a plugin for our push strategy.

In this guide, we would be building a simple analytics plugin that logs the push notification to the console and
keeps a count of the number of times a push notification is recieved.

## Create a Plugin

To create a plugin, we need to create a class that implements the `PushPlugin` interface right above our push handler code.

```typescript
// entry.worker.ts
import { PushPlugin } from "@remix-pwa/push";

class AnalyticsPlugin implements PushPlugin {
  // ...
}

// our `CustomPush` plugin
```

The `PushPlugin` interface has 4 methods that can be implemented:

- `pushReceived` - called when a push notification is recieved
- `pushClicked` - called when a push notification is clicked
- `pushDismissed` - called when a push notification is dismissed (closed)
- `error` - called when an error occurs during the push process

They all take in a `PushHandlerEnv` object that contains the following fields:

- `event` - An event is the event being passed to the plugin. It can be a `PushEvent` or a `NotificationEvent` or an `ErrorEvent`
- `state` - This is a type of `Record<string, any>` that allows you to pass any data to the plugin. It is useful when you want to pass data from one plugin to another
  or extra information to the plugin.

Since this is analytics plugin, we want to track all four. So we would implement all four methods.

```typescript
// entry.worker.ts
class AnalyticsPlugin implements PushPlugin {
  async pushReceived(push: PushHandlerEnv) {}

  async pushClicked(push: PushHandlerEnv) {}

  async pushDismissed(push: PushHandlerEnv) {}

  async error(error: PushHandlerEnv) {}
}
```

And before we move on, let's simulate a scenario. Sometimes, we want to track only a specific push notification event (for example, `pushRecieved`)
and not the others. To do that, let's create a field in `Analytics` plugin that would allow us to specify the event we want to track.

```typescript {1-6, 9}
// entry.worker.ts
interface AnalyticsPluginOptions {
  trackPushReceived?: boolean;
  trackPushClicked?: boolean;
  trackPushDismissed?: boolean;
  trackPushError?: boolean;
}

class AnalyticsPlugin implements PushPlugin {
  private options: AnalyticsPluginOptions;

  async pushReceived(push: PushHandlerEnv) {}

  async pushClicked(push: PushHandlerEnv) {}

  async pushDismissed(push: PushHandlerEnv) {}

  async error(error: PushHandlerEnv) {}
}
```

Let's also create a constructor that would allow us to pass in the options.

```typescript {4-12}
class AnalyticsPlugin implements PushPlugin {
  private options: AnalyticsPluginOptions;

  constructor(options: AnalyticsPluginOptions = {}) {
    this.options = {
      trackPushReceived: options.trackPushReceived ?? true,
      trackPushClicked: options.trackPushClicked ?? true,
      trackPushDismissed: options.trackPushDismissed ?? true,
      trackPushError: options.trackPushError ?? true,
      ...options
    };
  }

  async pushReceived(push: PushHandlerEnv) {}

  async pushClicked(push: PushHandlerEnv) {}

  async pushDismissed(push: PushHandlerEnv) {}

  async error(error: PushHandlerEnv) {}
}
```

Sweet, we have a plugin outline that we can use. Let's now implement the methods.

## Implement the Plugin Methods

### `pushReceived`

The `pushReceived` method is called when a push notification is recieved. We want to log the push notification to the console and
keep a count of the number of times a push notification is recieved. To do that, we would create a field in the `AnalyticsPlugin` class
that would keep track of the number of times a push notification is recieved.

```typescript {3}
class AnalyticsPlugin implements PushPlugin {
  private options: AnalyticsPluginOptions;
  private pushReceivedCount = 0;

  // ...
}
```

And then we would increment the count in the `pushReceived` method and log a message if the `trackPushReceived` option is set to `true`.

```typescript {2-6}
async pushReceived({ event, state }: PushHandlerEnv) {
  if (!this.options.trackPushReceived) return;

  this.pushReceivedCount++;
  console.log("Push recieved", event);
  console.log(`%cPush received ${this.pushReceivedCount}`, "color: green");
}
```

### `pushClicked`

The `pushClicked` method is called when a push notification is clicked. We would repeat the same step as above.

```typescript {4}
class AnalyticsPlugin implements PushPlugin {
  private options: AnalyticsPluginOptions;
  private pushReceivedCount = 0;
  private pushClickedCount = 0;

  // ...
}
```

And now, for the method:

```typescript {6-10}
class AnalyticsPlugin implements PushPlugin {
  // ...
  private pushClickedCount = 0;

  async pushClicked({ event, state }: PushHandlerEnv) {
    if (!this.options.trackPushClicked) return;

    this.pushClickedCount++;
    console.log("Push clicked", event);
    console.log(`%cPush clicked ${this.pushClickedCount}`, "color: blue");
  }

  // ...
}
```

### `pushDismissed`

The `pushDismissed` method is called when a push notification is dismissed. Same as above, we would create a field in the `AnalyticsPlugin` class
that would keep track of the number of times a push notification is dismissed.

```typescript {5}
class AnalyticsPlugin implements PushPlugin {
  private options: AnalyticsPluginOptions;
  private pushReceivedCount = 0;
  private pushClickedCount = 0;
  private pushDismissedCount = 0;

  // ...
}
```

Now, let's increment the count in the `pushDismissed` method and log a message

```typescript {6-10}
class AnalyticsPlugin implements PushPlugin {
  // ...
  private pushDismissedCount = 0;

  async pushDismissed({ event, state }: PushHandlerEnv) {
    if (!this.options.trackPushDismissed) return;

    this.pushDismissedCount++;
    console.log("Push dismissed", event);
    console.log(`%cPush dismissed ${this.pushDismissedCount}`, "color: yellow");
  }

  // ...
}
```

### `error`

The `error` method is called when an error occurs during the push process. Same. Hopefully, no errors occur during the push process. But if they do,
we are ready for it ðŸ˜Ž.

```typescript {6}
class AnalyticsPlugin implements PushPlugin {
  private options: AnalyticsPluginOptions;
  private pushReceivedCount = 0;
  private pushClickedCount = 0;
  private pushDismissedCount = 0;
  private errorCount = 0;

  // ...
}
```

And then we would increment the count in the `error` method and log a message

```typescript {2-6}
async error({ event, state }: PushHandlerEnv) {
  if (!this.options.trackPushError) return;

  this.errorCount++;
  console.log("Error", event);
  console.log(`%cError ${this.errorCount}`, "color: red");
}
```

## Implement the Plugin

Now that we have implemented the plugin methods, let's implement the plugin. We simply head back to our `CustomPush` declaration and slot the plugin 
into the `plugins` array.

```typescript 
// entry.worker.ts
const analyticsPlugin = new AnalyticsPlugin();

const pushHandler = new CustomPush([analyticsPlugin]);
```

<Info>
You might be wondering why we didn't just do `new AnalyticsPlugin()` straight up 
in the array. The answer is simply because we are tracking the number of times a push notification is recieved, clicked, dismissed and errored.

If we initialise a new instance directly, we would be initialising a new object every single time and 
resetting the count tracker back to zero. Typically, you should be sending to a server so it won't matter.
</Info>

## Test the Plugin

Currently, the plugin doesn't work. We need to make the `CustomPush` class aware of the plugin and actually call the plugin methods. 
Let's quickly fix that:

```ts 
// entry.worker.ts
class CustomPush extends Push {
  async handlePush(event: PushEvent): Promise<void> {
    this.applyPlugins("pushReceived", { event });

    // ...
  }

  async handleNotificationClick(event: NotificationEvent): Promise<void> {
    this.applyPlugins("pushClicked", { event });

    // ...
  }

  async handleNotificationClose(event: NotificationEvent): Promise<void> {
    this.applyPlugins("pushDismissed", { event });

    // ...
  }

  async handleError(error: ErrorEvent): Promise<void> {
    this.applyPlugins("error", { event: error });

    // ...
  }
}
```

<Info>
`applyPlugins` is a method that is available on the `Push` class and subsclasses. It takes in the name of the plugin method (`keyof PushPlugin`) and the `PushHandlerEnv` object
and then proceeds to call the plugin method under the hood.
</Info>

And now, our plugin is logging to and accurately keeping track just fine ðŸ¥³!

## Conclusion

Hopefully, this guide has been a good introduction to push notifications in Remix. If you 
have any further questions or suggestions, or maybe you created your own plugin and would 
love to share it to the community, feel free to reach out via a PR, issue or Github discussion.

Thanks for reading, and have a blast building! ðŸš€
