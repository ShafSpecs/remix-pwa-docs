Get started with `@remix-pwa/push` package for extending Service Workers in Remix with Push Notifications.

---

`@remix-pwa/push` is what I would like to call a headless package. Doesn't ship with a lot of features like `@remix-pwa/sw`, but it's designed to be extensible and customizable and for you to build out your own notification empire on top of it. It's a great starting point for building out a push service in your Remix application.

## Installation

To install `@remix-pwa/push` package, run the following command:

```bash
# npm
npm install @remix-pwa/push

# yarn
yarn add @remix-pwa/push
```

And you are good to go! ðŸŽ‰

<Info>
  `@remix-pwa/push` requires [`@remix-pwa/sw`](/sw) as a peer dependency. Make sure you have it installed in your
  application.
