import Warn from "./warn.tsx";
import Info from "./info.tsx";

In this guide, we would be setting up a chat application thats fully functional, and using Remix PWA,
we would utilise Push Notifications as well as Offline Support. And a few more surprises along the way ü´£.

Let's get started, shall we?

## Prerequisites

This guide makes use of a template project that you can clone and follow along with. You can find it [here](https://github.com/remix-pwa/remix-pwa-chat),
select "_Use this template_" to create a new repository with the same files and then clone using the `git clone` command.

Next up, install dependencies with the command:

```sh
npm install -f
```

<Warn>We use the `--force` flag due to a peer issue with `@remix-pwa` packages that aren't v1 yet.</Warn>

We would also be using [TalkJS](https://talkjs.com) for the chat functionality, so you would need to
create an account with them. Now, I can almost hear you go:

> Ummm, but ShafSpecs, I thought this was a free guide? Why do I need to create an account with TalkJS?
> Why can't we get our own chat functionality with our own backend?

Well, you can, but that would be a lot of work, and we are trying to keep this guide strictly to integrating
Remix PWA and avoid the pitfall of trying to explain how to build a chat app in Remix. So, we would be using
TalkJS to skip all of that setup, and is also free for development purposes, and works just well for our use case.

### Setting up TalkJS

Once you have created an account with TalkJS, you would need to create a new app. That is usually done automatically
once you login to your account dashboard. Now, this contains some various settings but we don't care about any of them except
the **Webhook** section, take note of that. And don't forget the two keys located at the top of the page, we would need them later.

## Setting our application up

The template ships with 6 different routes to hold our entire application:

- `/` - A homepage
- `/join` - A registration page. To join Remix Push üöÄ!
- `/login` - A login page. If you have an account with Remix Push, you can login here.
- `/logout` - A logout page. To logout of your account.
- `/chat` - The main chat page. Contains all your conversations
- `/chat/$chat` - A chat page. Contains a single conversation with one person.

<Info>
  Obviously, you can go ahead and expand this if you want. There are more possibilities like group chats, call, etc.
  It's all possible! For now, let's finish the setup
</Info>

### Setting up our environment variables

Rename the `.env.example` file to just `.env`. This is where we would be storing our environment variables.

<Warn>
  Make sure you don't commit this file to your repository. It contains sensitive information that should not be shared!
</Warn>

Now, open the file and fill in the following values:

- `TALKJS_APP_ID` - This is the ID of the TalkJS app you created earlier. The ID can be found on the dashboard.
- `TALKJS_SECRET_KEY` - This is the secret key of the TalkJS app you created earlier.
- `DATABASE_URL` - This is the URL to your database. We would be using SQLite file database for this guide.
- `SESSION_SECRET` - This is a secret key used to encrypt your session data. You can generate one [here](https://generate-secret.now.sh/64).

### Setting up our database

We aren't done with the setup yet, we still have to configure our database. We would be using [Prisma](https://prisma.io) as an ORM to help us
easily interact with our database. I've setup the schema for you so you won't need to do any editing to that for now.

We would still need to push our schema to the database. All I did was to define **how** the data would look, we still need to do the
actual population of the database, run the following command to do so:

```sh
npx prisma db push
```

Afterwards, we need to seed the database with some data, there are three users already defined in the `prisma/seed.ts` file, we would
use that to seed the database. Run the following command to do so:

```sh
npx prisma db seed
```

Now, if you run `npx prisma studio` and navigate to `localhost:5555`, you should see the `User` table contains 3 lovely people üòç.

### Setting up our routes

We are almost done with the setup, we just need to setup our routes. Head over to `app/routes/chat.$slug.tsx` and replace the string with your appId
[here](https://github.com/remix-pwa/remix-pwa-chat/blob/c0e9e4a4bd21d6cf04eef1fff80c84648210f34a/app/routes/chat.%24slug.tsx#L36).

We are now good to go! Run `npm run dev` and have fun chatting with yourself using different users ü§™. Let's get started!

## Bonus: Customising the Chat

<Info>
  As an extra challenge here, you can try to add a dark mode to the chat, you would need to create a new theme in tour
  TalkJS dashboard. More try-it-yourself would pop up as we go along :)
</Info>

Currently, the chat has a max. width of 420px, an ugly color scheme and it might just not be to your liking. To customise it, head over to
your TalkJS dashboard and head to the `Themes` tab. You can create a new theme (dark mode, for example) or edit the default theme to your taste.

## Setting up the Service Worker

The template ships with a `entry.worker.ts` file that contains barebones service worker code to install and activate it. Let's get more things rolling!

### Handling `fetch` events

Let's start by caching our assets. First thing we want to do is cache our `/images/*` assets, first of all, let's set up the `fetch` event listener, add
the following code to the `entry.worker.ts` file:

```ts
// `entry.worker.ts` file
const fetchHandler = async (event: FetchEvent): Promise<Response> => {};

self.addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
  event.respondWith(fetchHandler(event));
});
```

We would be using the `fetchHandler` function to handle all our fetch requests. Let's implement our various scenarios one by one.

```ts
// `fetchHandler` function
const { request } = event;

if (isAssetRequest(request, ["/images/"])) {
  // handler for images
} else if (isAssetRequest(request, ["/build/", "/favicon.ico"])) {
  // handler for build files
} else if (isLoaderRequest(request)) {
  // handler for loader requests
} else {
  // handler for other requests that don't match
}
```

Now, let's go create our actual caching strategies. We would be using `CacheFirst` for assets - meaning we would try to get the asset from the cache first,
and if it doesn't exist, we would fetch it from the network. For our loader requests, we would be using `NetworkFirst` - meaning we would try to get the
data from the network first, and if it fails, we would try to get it from the cache. Add the following above our `fetchHandler` function:

```ts
// `entry.worker.ts` file
const imageHandler = new CacheFirst({
  cacheName: "images-cache",
  isLoader: false,
  plugins: [],
  matchOptions: {
    ignoreSearch: true,
    ignoreVary: true
  }
});

const buildHandler = new CacheFirst({
  cacheName: "build-cache",
  isLoader: false,
  plugins: [],
  matchOptions: {
    ignoreSearch: true,
    ignoreVary: true
  }
});

const loaderHandler = new NetworkFirst({
  cacheName: "data-cache",
  isLoader: true,
  plugins: []
});
```

<Info>
  In case you are wondering if we can use the same asset handler and why we split them, it's because we want to have
  different cache names for each of them to illustrate the point that you can have multiple caches as you want. You can
  use the same handler for both of them if you want.
</Info>

Let's now go implement our `fetchHandler` fully:

```ts
if (isAssetRequest(request, ["/images/"])) {
  return imageHandler.handle(request);
} else if (isAssetRequest(request, ["/build/", "/favicon.ico"])) {
  return buildHandler.handle(request);
} else if (isLoaderRequest(request)) {
  return dataHandler.handle(request);
} else {
  return fetch(request);
}
```

Splendid! One more thing before we jump on the push bandwagon, and that's the `message` event. The template already comes with the hook
already present in `root.tsx`, but we need to listen to the message being sent from the client.

### Handling `message` events

That's easy! Just add the following code to the `entry.worker.ts` file:

```ts
// `entry.worker.ts` file
const messageHandler = new RemixNavigationHandler({
  dataCacheName: "data-cache",
  documentCacheName: "document-cache"
});

self.addEventListener("message", (event: ExtendableMessageEvent) => {
  event.waitUntil(messageHandler.handle(event));
});
```

<Warn>
  Note, the `dataCacheName` is the same cache used for the loader data handler. It's a must to use the same name (else,
  weird things start happening :()
</Warn>

Okay, now that we have that done. Let's go ahead and start pushing notifications to the user üöÄ!

## Push Notifications

Ok, this is the section we've all been waiting for!

We are going to create everything needed to get push notifications working. First, we need to create a `push` event listener in our service worker,
create a way to push messages, and oh! before I forget, we need to keep track of the users (If I signed in one more than one device, I should be pinged
on all). Let's get started!

### Setting up the server

We would be utilising a resource route for handling anything and everything push. Let's create a `push.ts` (_I like the name, you can call it whatever you
want_) file in our `app/routes` folder and create a new `action` function. We can return null for now, we would come back to it later.

For now, let's set up a new `enum` called `NotificationType`. Recall that this route is supposed to handle everything push, so we need to differentiate
between the various types of notifications we would be sending. Add the following code to the `push.ts` file:

```ts
// `push.ts` file
export enum NotificationType {
  NOTIFY = "NOTIFY",
  NOTIFY_ALL = "NOTIFY_ALL",
  REGISTER_DEVICE = "REGISTER_DEVICE",
  UNREGISTER_DEVICE = "UNREGISTER_DEVICE",
  UNREGISTER_ALL_DEVICES = "UNREGISTER_ALL_DEVICES"
}

export const action: ActionFunction = async ({ request }) => {
  let user = await getUser(request);
  const data = await request.json();

  const { type } = data as { type: NotificationType };

  switch (type) {
    case NotificationType.NOTIFY: {
    }
    case NotificationType.NOTIFY_ALL: {
    }
    case NotificationType.REGISTER_DEVICE: {
    }
    case NotificationType.UNREGISTER_DEVICE: {
    }
    case NotificationType.UNREGISTER_ALL_DEVICES: {
    }
  }

  return null;
};
```

This is the skeleton of our notification, this is where you would want to fine-tune based on your use case. For this tutorial, we would be implementing
the following:

- `NOTIFY`: Send a notification to a specific user (send a message to all devices of a specific user)
- `NOTIFY_ALL`: Send a notification to all users (broadcast a message to everyone)
- `REGISTER_DEVICE`: Register a device for a user (when a user logs in)
- `UNREGISTER_DEVICE`: Unregister a device for a user (when a user logs out)
- `UNREGISTER_ALL_DEVICES`: Unregister all devices for a user (when accounts get deleted, for example)

_Clap, clap, clap_! We are done with the server side of things for now. Let's go ahead and implement the client side.

### Setting up the client

We would be using the `Notification` API to handle all our notifications. Let's do two things for now, subscribe to push notifications when the user logs in
and unsubscribe when the user logs out.

The last one is easy, head over to the 'Logout' button in [`app/routes/chat.tsx`](https://github.com/remix-pwa/remix-pwa-chat/blob/1ea915484e5abc5b312435c725d24620035448d6/app/routes/chat.tsx#L281)
and add this line of code just before the `logout` route is navigated to:

```ts
unsubscribeFromPush("/push", NotificationType.UNREGISTER_DEVICE.valueOf());
```

`unsubscribeFromPush` takes in two optional arguments, the first is the `push` route (the route where your push action lies, defaults to '/push'), and the second is the `type` of notification (what type should be sent to the server?
Defaults to _'unsubscribe'_).

For the first one, we would be using the `useEffect` hook to subscribe to push notifications based on the current subscription status. Add the following
code to the `app/routes/chat.tsx` file:

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
    (async () => {
      const pushSubscriptionStatus = await getPushSubscriptionStatus();

      if (pushSubscriptionStatus) {
        return;
      } else {
        subscribeToPush("VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY", "/push", NotificationType.REGISTER_DEVICE.valueOf());
      }
    })();
  }
}, []);
```

A little bit of explanation here. We are using the `useEffect` hook to subscribe to push notifications when the component mounts but since
`navigator` is not available on the server, we need to check if `window` is available before we do anything. We are also using the `getPushSubscriptionStatus`
function to check if the user is already subscribed to push notifications. If the user is already subscribed, we do nothing, else, we subscribe the user.

`subscribeToPush` takes in three optional arguments, the first is the `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` (the public key of your VAPID keys), the second is the `push` route (the route where your push action lies, defaults to '/push'),
and the third is the `type` of notification (what type should be sent to the server? Defaults to _'subscribe'_).

### Subscribing the user

Let's now head back to our `push.tsx` file and implement the two functions we need to subscribe and unsubscribe the user. You can break up the code here and move the follwoing
implementation to separate files, that's all good and clean. I, on the other hand, shall do none of that in this guide!

Let's handle subscription first. `subscribeToPush` already handles the subscription for us, all we need to do is to save the subscription in the database.

<Info>
  The reason we send the subscription to the server is because we need to save it afterwards and keep track of the user
  subscriptions across devices. Also, we handle the notification sending from the server, so we need to send the
  subscription to the server.
</Info>

Let's update the `REGISTER_DEVICE` case in our `push.ts` file:

```ts
const { subscription } = data as { subscription: PushSubscription };

await db.user
  .update({
    where: { id: user?.id },
    data: {
      subscriptions: {
        create: {
          endpoint: subscription.endpoint,
          keys: JSON.stringify({
            // @ts-ignore
            p256dh: subscription.keys.p256dh,
            // @ts-ignore
            auth: subscription.keys.auth
          })
        }
      }
    }
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error(err);
    return err;
  });

return new Response(null, {
  status: 200
});
```

This is pretty straightforward, we are just saving the subscription in the database. We are also stringifying the `keys` object because JSON type doesn't exist in
SQLite _afaik_. The `//@ts-ignore` is just to ignore the TS error that comes up when you try to access the `p256dh` and `auth` properties of the `keys` object, no idea why but
it must be faulty typing üòâ. Anyway, if you run `npx prisma studio` and open up the subscription table, you should see a subscription.

If you don't see one, try removing the `if` conditional in the `useEffect` in `chat.tsx`. It's possible you are already subscribed to push
on `localhost`.

### Unsubscribing the user

This should be pretty straightforward, all we do is delete the subscription we just created in the database, our client already unsubscribes
when we logout, let's do it for real in our database:

```ts
// push.ts - case `UNREGISTER_DEVICE`
const { subscription } = data as { subscription: PushSubscription };

await db.subscription.delete({
  where: { endpoint: subscription.endpoint }
});
```

Beautiful! You can logout and login and see the subscription going poof üí• and coming back. Let's now send something for real!

## Sending notifications

Let's get our service worker to listen for push events and send a notification when it receives one. Head over to `entry.worker.ts` and let's do some
work there. We would set up our listener, get the data from the push event, and send a notification. Let's do it:

```ts
// entry.worker.ts
self.addEventListener("push", (event) => {});

self.addEventListener("notificationclick", (event) => {});

self.addEventListener("notificationclose", (event) => {});

self.addEventListener("error", (error) => {});
```

Let's create a new push handler and implement its methods:

```ts
class PushHandler extends Push {
  async handlePush(event: PushEvent): Promise<void> {}

  async handleNotificationClick(event: NotificationEvent): Promise<void> {}

  async handleNotificationClose(event: NotificationEvent): Promise<void> {}

  async handleError(error: ErrorEvent): Promise<void> {}
}

const pushHandler = new PushHandler();
```

> Tip: Update the `push` event listener to implement all the methods in the `PushHandler` class.

Let's now implement the `handlePush` method, that's the main one we need to send notifications:

```ts
// entry.worker.ts
async handlePush(event: PushEvent) {
    const data = event.data?.json() || {};

    await self.registration.showNotification(data.title, data.options)
  }
```

Now, let's actually utilise the push handler and actually push something to the user. Head over to the `push.ts` file and update the `NOTIFY` case:

```ts
// push.ts - case `NOTIFY`
const { notification } = data as { notification: NotificationObject };

const userSubscriptions = await db.user.findUnique({
  where: { id: user.id },
  select: { subscriptions: true }
});

if (!userSubscriptions) {
  return new Response("User not found", { status: 403 });
}

const subscriptions = userSubscriptions.subscriptions.map((subscription) => {
  return {
    endpoint: subscription.endpoint,
    keys: JSON.parse(subscription.keys)
  };
});

sendNotifications({
  // @ts-ignore PushSubscription types are conflicting, web-push types vs web worker types.
  subscriptions: [...subscriptions],
  vapidDetails: {
    publicKey: process.env.VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY ?? "",
    privateKey: process.env.VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY ?? "",
    subject: "mailto:test@test.com"
  },
  ttl: 5_000,
  log: true,
  notification
});

return new Response(null, {
  status: 200
});
```

This one is a bit long, let's break it down. First, we get all the user subscriptions from the database, then we map over them to create a valid subscription object.
Using the `sendNotifications` function, we send the notification to all the subscriptions. The `sendNotifications` function is a wrapper around the `web-push` library,
it takes in the subscriptions, the user vapid details, the ttl (time to live) of the notification which is optional (default time of 10 seconds), and the notification object itself. The `log` option is just to log
the response from the `web-push` library, you can remove it if you want.

<Warn>
  Currently, `@remix-pwa/push` doesn't provide any API to help notify at the tap of a button. We will implement sending
  data from client to server ourselved for now, till it's added to the library.
</Warn>

Finally, let's head into that our `useEffect` hook we created earlier for subscription management and send a default notification:

```ts
setTimeout(async () => {
  const data = {
    notification: {
      title: "Remix Push",
      options: {
        body: "Hello There!"
      }
    },
    type: "NOTIFY"
  };

  let response = await fetch("/push", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
  });

  return response;
}, 2_000);
```

And that's it! After 2 seconds, you should get a notification on your device. Cool, isn't it? Now we can send notifications to our users, let's
expand it and send notifications **when** a message comes in.

### Listening to message events

Okay, I got bad news. TalkJS doesn't ship with websockets, so how do we listen for new messages? Well, we can't, at least not with not with sockets. We can however
request TalkJS to ping our server when a new message comes in. Let's do that.

Remember the *Webhook* section I told you to take not of earlier when setting up your account? Well, good thing cause we would ask TalkJS to hit our `/push` route 
when a new message comes in. Another bad news, we are on localhost, so we can't use webhooks. We can't deploy either so we are stuck. Well, not really, we can use
a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose our localhost to the internet. Let's quickly get that done.

### Exposing localhost to the internet

Head over to [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and create an account with minimal details for free. After that, download the ngrok binary and follow the steps on 
your dashboard to connect your account. Don't worry, it's a single command:

```sh 
ngrok config add-authtoken <YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>
```

After that, run the following command to expose your localhost to the internet:

```sh
# If you aren't using port 3000, change it to your port
ngrok http 3000
```

You should see something like this:

```sh
ngrok                                                                       (Ctrl+C to quit)

Announcing ngrok-rust: The ngrok agent as a Rust crate: https://ngrok.com/rust

Session Status                online

```

We have our localhost exposed to the internet! let's head over to our TalkJS dashboard and add a webhook. Head over to the *Webhooks* section and update your *Webhook URL*
to the ngrok url. It should look something like this:

```sh
https://<ADDRESS>.ngrok.io/push
```

<Warn>
Make sure to tick `message.sent` in the *Webhooks* section.

If you can't access your ngrok url, make sure you authenticated your account before running the command.
</Warn>

We can even visit our temporary ngrok site and use it like a deployed site. Cool! 

### Getting triggers from TalkJS

Now that we have our webhook setup, let's head over to our `push.ts` file and update the push action. TalkJS doesn't follow our `type` syntax
when sending messages, so we listen to the type of the webhook message and transform it ourselves. The code should explain better:

```ts
let { type } = data as { type: NotificationType | string };

if (type == "message.sent") {
  type = NotificationType.NOTIFY
}
```

TalkJS sends a type alongside their webhook message, we check if the type is `message.sent` and transform it to our `NotificationType.NOTIFY` type.
Now, let's go have fun with our new notifications and modify the notify case in our `push.ts` file:

```ts
case NotificationType.NOTIFY: {
  const sender = data.data.sender;
  const participants = Object.keys(data.data.conversation.participants) as any[]
  const recieverId = participants.filter((user) => sender.id !== user)[0];

  user = await db.user.findUnique({
    where: { id: recieverId },
    select: { id: true, name: true, email: true, avatar: true },
  })

  if (!user) {
    return new Response("User not found", { status: 403 });
  }

  const notification: NotificationObject = {
    title: `${sender.name}`,
    options: {
      body: `${data.data.message.text}`,
      // other possible values, these are experimental tho üòâ
      // [silent, vibrate, tag, renotify, requireInteraction, timestamp, image]
    }
  } 

  const userSubscriptions = await db.user.findUnique({
    where: { id: user.id },
    select: { subscriptions: true },
  });

  if (!userSubscriptions) {
    return new Response("User not found", { status: 403 });
  }

  const subscriptions = userSubscriptions.subscriptions.map((subscription) => {
    return {
      endpoint: subscription.endpoint,
      keys: JSON.parse(subscription.keys),
    };
  })

  sendNotifications({
    // @ts-ignore
    subscriptions: [...subscriptions],
    vapidDetails: {
      publicKey: process.env.VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY ?? "",
      privateKey: process.env.VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY ?? "",
      subject: "mailto:test@test.com",
    },
    ttl: 5_000,
    log: true,
    notification,
  });

  return new Response(null, {
    status: 200
  })
}
```

> By the way, delete the `setTimeout` we added earlier in our `useEffect` hook to test out notifications.

That's quite long, TalkJS tends to nest everything in a funny way. Let's break it down:

- We get the sender of the message and the participants of the conversation.
- We filter out the sender from the participants to get the reciever of the message.
- We get the reciever from our database. We need the reciever's subscription to send the notification.
- We create a notification object with the sender's name and the message text.
- We get the reciever's subscriptions from our database.
- We map through the subscriptions and return an object with the endpoint and keys.
- We send the notification to the reciever.

That's it! We have our notifications working. Let's test it out.

### Testing our notifications

Head over to your TalkJS dashboard and start a conversation with another user. You should get a notification on your device. If you don't, check your console for errors.

Or you can open an incognito tab, login as another user and then start a conversation with the first user. You should get a notification on your device!

## Conclusion

We have successfully added push notifications to our TalkJS chat app. We saved our user subscriptions in our database and used them to send notifications to our users.
We also used a service worker to listen to incoming notifications and display them to our users. We also used an external service to communicate with our app 
in order to facilitate sending notifications (*this can get more creative, like an admin dashboard to broadcast messages or similar*). 

This guide is just a starting point, you can build on it to add more features to your application, the limit is non-existent! It's also quite long for starters but I wanted to make sure a lot was explained 
as to how you would utilise it in a real application, if you've got any issues or questions, feel free to reach out via our Github or Discord.

## Bonuses

- Add a web manifest to your application to make it installable on devices.
- Implement the `notificationClick` method in the `PushHandler` class to open the chat page when a notification is clicked.

- Implement a user profile to allow users to update their information as well as their profile picture.
- Make the app more accessible by adding a dark mode and a light mode.
- Add better accessibility to the application to allow better navigation and usage of the application.
