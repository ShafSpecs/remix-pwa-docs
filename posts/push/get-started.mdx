import Info from "./info.tsx";

In this guide, we are going to build out our own push notification system, it would be simple, nothing too complex, but it will give you a good idea of how to use the Remix PWA Push package.

## Prerequisites

You would need a Service Worker to be able to use the Remix PWA Push package, if you don't have one,
check out the [service worker package](/sw). Your service worker doesn't need to do anything, it just
needs to be built by `esbuild` when your application runs. This [guide](/sw/basic-setup#create-a-service-worker)
would get you started if you haven't gotten a service worker yet.

You would also require `@remix-pwa/push` to be installed (_after all, this is the docs for it_).

## Getting Started

Let's get this over with, shall we? Firstly, we want to provide a structure/layout in our service worker for working with push (no pun intended).

```ts
self.addEventListener("push", (event) => {});

self.addEventListener("notificationclick", (event) => {});

self.addEventListener("notificationclose", (event) => {});

self.addEventListener("error", (error) => {});
```

The `push` event is fired when a push notification is received, the `notificationclick` event is fired when a notification is clicked,
the `notificationclose` event is fired when a notification is closed, and the `error` event is fired when an error occurs. Perfect!

We could have skipped the last three but we want to be able to handle errors and clicks on notifications, don't we? Plus, it gives us more
control over the notifications.

Next up, we need a [resource route](https://remix.run/docs/en/1.16.1/guides/resource-routes) to handle the push notifications from the server, we would call it `push.ts` (_because '/push' is befitting in my opinion_)

```ts
// push.ts
import type { ActionFunction } from "@remix-run/node";

export const action: ActionFunction = async ({ request }) => {
  return null;
};
```

<Info>
Push API, to be put simple, has two main parts. The client side which is your application that the user interfaces with and the server side, which you control.

Afterall, Push API gives the the ability to your application to receive messages pushed to them from a server,
whether or not the web app is in the foreground, or even currently loaded, on a user agent. So somehow, you need to keep track of users (aka subscriptions). Could be in
a database, a simple text/CSV file, or even a service like [Pusher](https://pusher.com/).

</Info>

Ah, so beautiful _and quite empty too_! Let's do something about that. We want to be able to subscribe to push notifications after all.

### Setting up the client

`@remix-pwa/push` comes with two main functions for working with push notifications, `subscribeToPush` and `unsubscribeFromPush`.
Let's spin create a simple route for subscribing to push notifications.

```
import { subscribeToPush } from "@remix-pwa/push";

export default function PushRoute() {
  const [subscribed, setSubscribed] = useState(false);

  const subscribe = () => {}

  return (
    <div style={{ fontFamily: "system-ui, sans-serif", lineHeight: "1.4" }}>
      <h1>Welcome to Remix Push</h1>
      <div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "row" }}>
        <h2 style={{ margin: "12px 16px" }}>Subscribe to Notifications?</h2>
        <button onClick={subscribe} style={{ padding: "4px 12px" }}>Subscribe Me!</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

First of all, I know this thing looks hideous, but it's just a demo, so bear with me please. Or go ahead and add some flair all you like!
Now that we have that out of the way, let's explain what we're doing. We have a simple button that should subscribe to push notifications when clicked.
Next, we have a state called `subscribed` that is a boolean, it would be used to determine if the user is subscribed or not. Typically, you would want to save this
in a `Context` or even a `Reducer`. Or skip saving it at all and just fetch from the subscription status from the server, but since we ain't doing
that, we would just save it in a state.

In the meantime, quickly run:

```bash
npm i dotenv web-push
```

and in your `entry.server.tsx` file, add:

```ts
import "dotenv/config";
```

We need to install `dotenv` because we would be using environment variables, and `web-push` because we would be using it to generate our VAPID keys and send push info from the server.

<Info>
  `VAPID` stands for *Voluntary Application Server Identity*, it's a way to identify who is sending the push
  notification and is auto-generated.
</Info>

Generate your vapid keys with the command:

```bash
npx web-push generate-vapid-keys
```

And save the output in your `.env` file as `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` and `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` respectively.

### Cleaning up the client

Now that we have our keys, let's go back to our `PushRoute` and implement the `subscribe` function.

```ts
const subscribe = async () => {
  await subscribeToPush("Your-Vapid-Public-Key", "/push");
  setSubscribed(true);
};
```

`subscribeToPush` returns a promise, so we need to `await` it. It takes in your VAPID public key as an argument and the route
where you are handling push optionally (in our case, '_/push_'). If successful, it returns a subscription object that you can save in
your database (if you for some reason, chose to not save it server-side) or an error if things went haywire.

## Set up the Server

Right now, our client is mostly ready. Now, let's quickly implement the server and start pushing those
notifications! Check out the code below:

```ts
import type { ActionArgs } from "@remix-run/node";

export const action = async ({ request }: ActionArgs) => {
  const body = await request.json();

  const { type } = body;

  switch (type) {
    case "subscribe":
      break;
    case "unsubscribe":
      break;
  }

  return null;
};
```

We have a simple switch statement that checks the type of request we are getting. If it's a `subscribe` request, we would save the subscription in our database, if it's an `unsubscribe` request, we would remove the subscription from our database. Simple, right?

<Info>
  `subscribeToPush` and `unsubscribeFromPush` also send the `type` as a string in their payload when sending along the
  subscription object. You can extend this by adding more cases when you want to send along your own custom
  notification, etc. For example, `notify-all` to notify all subscriptions present in your database.
</Info>

### Saving the Subscription

This entire section is relative to how your application is structured. You can save your subscription data in a JSON file or a database field, it's your choice.
I would store mine in the browser's `LocalStorage` for the sake of simplicity.

```ts
// push.ts
export const action: ActionFunction = async ({ request }) => {
  const body = await request.json();

  const { type } = body;

  switch (type) {
    case "subscribe":
      console.log("subscribed");
      return json(body.subscription, {
        status: 201
      });
    case "unsubscribe":
      console.log("unsubscribed");
      return json(true, {
        status: 200
      });
  }

  return null;
};
```

`subscribeToPush` sends a `subscription` object in the payload, which should be saved in your database. In our case, we would just return it as a response and save in `localStorage`.

<Info>
  You want to avoid saving Push information in the client because that means the user would need to be 
  actively using your application to receive push notifications. If they are not, they would not receive any notifications.

Plus, you won't be able to send mass notifications to all your users if the subscription is saved in the client.

</Info>

Let's update our `subscribe` function to save the subscription in `localStorage`:

```ts
const subscribe = async () => {
  const subscription = await subscribeToPush("your-public-key", "/push").then((res) => res.json());

  window.localStorage.setItem("subscription", JSON.stringify(subscription));
  setSubscribed(true);
};
```

Sweet! We are done with all the saving. I didn't add any error handling, but you typically should. I also skipped
the `unsubscribe` function, but it's pretty much the same as the `subscribe` function, except that unsubscribing to the [`PushManager`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushManager)
returns a promise that resolves to a boolean, we just returned `true` in our case.

Now, let's move on to the fun part, sending push notifications 🪄!

## Sending Push Notifications

Sending push notifications is pretty straightforward. We would be using the `web-push` library to send our notifications. Let's quickly install it if you haven't already:

```bash
npm i web-push
```

Now, let's modify our index component to allow us to send push notifications when subscribed:

```
return (
  <div style={{ fontFamily: "system-ui, sans-serif", lineHeight: "1.4" }}>
    <h1>Welcome to Remix Push</h1>
    <div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "row" }}>
      {subscribed ? (
        <Fragment>
          <h2 style={{ margin: "12px 16px" }}>You are subscribed to push notifications!</h2>
          <button
            onClick={() => {
              /* Implement this yourself 😉 */
            }}
            style={{ padding: "4px 12px" }}
          >
            Unsubscribe
          </button>
          <button style={{ padding: "4px 12px", margin: "0 8px" }} onClick={() => sendPush()}>
            Send Me a Push! 🚀
          </button>
        </Fragment>
      ) : (
        <Fragment>
          <h2 style={{ margin: "12px 16px" }}>Subscribe to Notifications?</h2>
          <button onClick={subscribe} style={{ padding: "4px 12px" }}>
            Subscribe Me!
          </button>
        </Fragment>
      )}
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

Just a simple button to send a push notification when clicked. Let's implement the `sendPush` function:

```ts
const sendPush = async () => {
  const subscription = JSON.parse(window.localStorage.getItem("subscription")!);

  const res = await fetch("/push", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      type: "notify",
      subscription
    })
  });

  if (res.ok) {
    console.log("Push sent!");
  }
};
```

We are sending a `POST` request to our `/push` route with the `subscription` object we saved earlier. 
We also send a `type` of `notify` to let our server know that we want to send a push notification. Let's implement the server-side code:

```ts
// push.ts
case "notify":
  console.log("notified");
  const notification = {
    title: "Hello from Remix!",
    options: {
      body: "This is a notification from Remix!",
      icon: "/favicon.png",
    },
  }

  sendNotifications({
    subscriptions: [body.subscription],
    ttl: 15_000,
    vapidDetails: {
      subject: "mailto:test@test.com",
      publicKey: process.env.VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY ?? "",
      privateKey: process.env.VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY ?? "",
    },
    notification,
  });
  break;
```

`sendNotifications` is a function that takes in an object with the following properties:

- `subscriptions`: An array of `subscription` objects to send the notification to (if you wanted a campaign, you dump all subscriptions in here).
- `ttl`: The time to live of the notification in milliseconds.
- `vapidDetails`: An object containing the `subject`, `publicKey` and `privateKey` of your VAPID keys.
- `notification`: An object containing the `title` and `options` of the notification. You can check out the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerRegistration/showNotification) for more information.

Awesome! We are done 🚀! Or, are we 🤔?

## Testing it Out

<Info>
  This section is only for entertainment purposes.
</Info>

Let's test out our application. Run `npm run dev` to start the server and open up `localhost:3000` in your browser.
If you didn't implement `unsubscribe` and want to unsubscribe manually, you can simply delete the `subscription` key from `localStorage` and refresh the page.

Now, click on the "Subscribe Me!" button and you should see a prompt asking you to allow notifications. Click on `Allow` and you would now be subscribed to push notifications,
click on the send push button and hooray... nothing happens 😢. Why's that? Cause we didn't implement anything in the service worker to handle push notifications 🤦‍♂️.
