In this guide, we would be implementing our own Push Handler. By default, `@remix-pwa/push` ships with only an abstract `Push` class that
is to be extended by the user. Unlike `@remix-pwa/sw` that ships with some default strategies, `@remix-pwa/push` does not ship with any default strategy
because of the nature of Push Notifications and also to allow extensibility.

## Creating a Push Handler

To create our own Push Handler, we would want to extend the `Push` abstract class and implement it's methods. The `Push` class has the following methods:

- `handlePush` - This method is called when a push event is received.
- `handleNotificationClick` - This method is called when a notification is clicked.
- `handleNotificationClose` - This method is called when a notification is closed.
- `handleError` - This method is called when an error occurs.

It also contains one property: `plugins` which is an array of plugins to be used by the Push Handler.

<Info>
You don't need to provide implementation for all four methods, if you only care about receiving push events 
but not the others, you can simply provide an implementation for `handlePush` and leave the others empty.

Note: All methods are abstract and must be implemented but they could be empty.

</Info>

Let's create an outline for our Push Handler:

```ts
// entry.worker.ts
import { Push } from "@remix-pwa/push";

class CustomPush extends Push {
  async handlePush(event: PushEvent): Promise<void> {}

  async handleNotificationClick(event: NotificationEvent): Promise<void> {}

  async handleNotificationClose(event: NotificationEvent): Promise<void> {}

  async handleError(error: ErrorEvent): Promise<void> {}
}
```

and that's it! We have created our own Push Handler. Now, let's see how we can use it. First, let's
hook it up to the event listeners:

```ts
// entry.worker.ts
const pushHandler = new CustomPush();

self.addEventListener("push", (event: PushEvent) => {
  pushHandler.handlePush(event);
});

self.addEventListener("notificationclick", (event: NotificationEvent) => {
  pushHandler.handleNotificationClick(event);
});

self.addEventListener("notificationclose", (event: NotificationEvent) => {
  pushHandler.handleNotificationClose(event);
});

self.addEventListener("error", (error: ErrorEvent) => {
  pushHandler.handleError(error);
});
```

### Handling Push Events

{/* Todo: Ship a default push with overridable click, close and error but a simple push handler that has plugins in mind too */}

The `handlePush` method is called when a push event is received. Since we want to see our pretty
push notifications sent from the [last](/push/get-started) guide, we would want to show a notification when a push event is received.

```ts {3-4}
// entry.worker.ts
class CustomPush extends Push {
  async handlePush(event: PushEvent): Promise<void> {
    const { data } = event;
    await self.registration.showNotification(data?.json().title, data?.json().options);
  }

  async handleNotificationClick(event: NotificationEvent): Promise<void> {}

  async handleNotificationClose(event: NotificationEvent): Promise<void> {}

  async handleError(error: ErrorEvent): Promise<void> {}
}
```

If you came from the previous guide, I'm sure you can't wait to test it out. Well, go ahead and send a push notification and see it in action.
It works this time! A push notification service is already up and running in the background, so you don't need to start it again ðŸ™Œ.

### Handling Notification Clicks

We could wrap up the guide at this point and call it a day, but let's go a step further and handle notification clicks.
When a notification is clicked, we would want to open a new window to the URL specified in the notification.

Update your notification `options` in `push.ts` to contain the a `url` property:

```ts {5}
// push.ts
const notification = {
  title: "Hello from Remix!",
  options: {
    body: "This is a notification from Remix!",
    icon: "/favicon.png",
    data: {
      url: "https://remix.run"
    }
  }
};
```

and then update your `handleNotificationClick` method to open a new window to the URL:

```ts {2-8}
// entry.worker.ts
async handleNotificationClick(event: NotificationEvent) {
  const { notification } = event;
  console.log(notification)
  if (notification?.data?.url) {
    console.timeLog("Opening window")
    await self.clients.openWindow(notification.data.url);
  }
  notification?.close();
}
```

Now, when you click on the notification, it should open a new window to the URL specified in the notification and close the notification.
Whooppee! ðŸŽ‰

### Handling Notification Close

Finally, let's handle notification close. When a notification is closed, we would want to log a message to the console.

```ts {2-3}
async handleNotificationClose(event: NotificationEvent) {
  const { notification } = event;
  console.log("Notification with title", `'${notification.title}'`, "closed");
}
```

### Handling Errors

The last method we need to implement is the `handleError` method. This method is called when an error occurs. We can 
simply log the error to the console here. In other situations, you might want to send the error to a server for logging.

```ts {2-3}
async handleError(error: ErrorEvent) {
  console.error("An error occurred", error);
}
```

Congratulations! We have successfully created our own Push Handler! ðŸŽ‰

You can stop here and be fine, but do please move on to the [next](/push/custom-plugin) guide to learn how to use plugins to extend your Push Handler.
